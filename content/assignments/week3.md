Last week we started talking about Kant’s conception of free action. This week we’ll
try and get clearer as to the notion of ‘control’ that lies behind this conception of
free action. In terms of readings from Kant we’ll be focusing on much of the same
material from last week plus a few other things.

I want to focus our discussion around the following questions:

1.  Is Kant’s conception of absolute spontaneity made more intelligible by appeal to
    his view of control?
2.  What is the connection, for Kant, between control and responsibiilty?
3.  Does control require choice?
4.  If rational acts are all and only those that are under one’s control, and control
    is dependent on choice how does Kant avoid (if he does) an implausibly
    voluntaristic position?
