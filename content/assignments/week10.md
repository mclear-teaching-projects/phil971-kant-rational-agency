This week we finish our discussion of Burge and Boyle on doxastic agency. We then
look at criticism of both reflective control (Hieronymi) and of doxastic agency more
generally (Setiya).


## Readings {#readings}

-   Hieronymi, "[Reflection and Responsibility](/materials/readings/hieronymi-reflection.pdf)"
    -   Note that we'll be focusing primarily on her criticism of reflection theories,
        and less on her positive account of responsibility
-   Setiya, "[Epistemic Agency: Some Doubts](/materials/readings/setiya-agency.pdf)"
