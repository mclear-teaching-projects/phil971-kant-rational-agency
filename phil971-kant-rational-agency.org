The course aims to elucidate Kant's conception of rational agency, in both its
theoretical and practical forms. Kant's view is then compared and contrasted with
contemporary, broadly kantian, approaches. We'll read various parts of Kant's
Critical works, alongside contemporary figures like Neta, Malmgren, Pereboom,
Korsgaard, Frankfurt, Velleman, Bratman, Boyle, Wolf, and Schafer. I'm also working on a
book manuscript on these issues, so we'll read parts from the manuscript as well.

Below is a rough plan of topics and readings (all subject to change). We'll end the
course with a guest appearance by Karl Schafer, to discuss his book manuscript on
Kant's conception of reason.

*** Reading responses

**** Eunhong
- Kant assumes that all casuality is sufficient causality – but why assume this? 
- 
**** John
#+begin_quote
why claim that the “conditioned” is not a subject matter of transcendental criticism
when the very validation of said concept is grounded on the phenomena, out from which
analyticity seems established. Isn’t this precisely the job of transcendental
criticism?
#+end_quote

- the concept <conditioned> analytically entails <condition>; so the very claim about
  the conditioned being given also gives its conditions is not something to which
  Kant objects. Hence no fear of transncendental criticism.

 The concept thus isn’t “established” by an appeal to phenomena (or appaearances)

#+begin_quote
it seems to me that Kant takes freedom and necessity as contradiction – i.e., the
demonstration of one must occasion the negation of the other (Alison 394). Why?
#+end_quote

- OK good - but first, why think that Kant endorses this opposition? And if he does
  what justification might there be for it?
- John makes a further point but I didn’t understand it
  

**** Chen
#+begin_quote
My question here is, does this mean [i.e. the separation of natural and free/intelligible
causality] that acting subjects have the same power of choice so they will make the
same decision under one circumstance? Or, if subjects will make different decisions
based on their previous experiences, how could Kant separate freedom from natural
causality completely? (Maybe Kant is not faced with such questions?)
#+end_quote

- Seems like this question might be answered by looking at the difference between
  intelligible and empirical character

**** Janelle
- NO Response

**** Trevor
#+begin_quote
I was always taught that Kant believes the world as it appears to us seems to have
causation but we don’t know whether things-in-themselves are in such law-like causal
relations. So why doesn’t Kant just admit that things-in-themselves may be free even
if all appearances and reasoning about appearances seem to suggest otherwise?
#+end_quote

- Question for Trevor: Is free action supposed to be non-deterministic? 

#+begin_quote
it strikes me as weird he is even talking about incompatibilism if we aren’t even aware of the true nature of things
#+end_quote

- Why talk about incompatibilism if we cannot know anything about things in
  themselves? 

#+begin_quote
if we are ignorant of our own nature, isn’t it possible that once we are “wound up”
so-to-speak we are then able to truly determine what happens? Put it another way, the
turnspit is wound up and then has the power of movement. Perhaps once we are “wound
up” we have a true two-way power, to cause either event A or event B.
#+end_quote

- OK - so what is it to “truly determine what happens”? 
- But fair question: why think we have anything more than ‘relative spontaneity’?
  
** Week 3
*** Logisitics
**** Precis questions
- in general paraphrase over quotation
- remember that these should be *shortentails the existence of a ground over which the agent can exert no causal inﬂuence*!

*** Reading Responses

**** Trevor
1. How can Kant say that practical and speculative freedom have nothing to do with
   one another?
   - As I said in class this is a controversial issue, and it points to the
     possibility that Kant had different competing conceptions of free action in his
     theory, some that were broadly compatibilist and some that were broadly
     incompatibilist. It is also possible that Kant simply changed his mind about
     certain core issues. 
2. What’s the difference between a practical presupposition and a presupposition more generally?
   - Kant is aiming to distinguish between presuppositions of acting in the world
     (i.e. what the world ought to be), vs. those that might be presuppositions of
     theoretical inquiry (i.e. inquiry as to what the world is). Kant’s view seems to
     be that the ‘speculative’ issue of whether we are absolutely
     spontaneous/transcendentally free is an issue that we can never give a
     satisfying answer, because we lack the right relationship to reality to be able
     to cognize the truth of our freedom. Nevertheless it may be the case that we
     “presuppose” our freedom in our actions in various ways. For example, if
     determinism is true, I’m not responsible for anything I do. However, if
     determinism is true I still have to deliberate as to what to do (it’s just that
     it turns out that my deliberations are temporally necessitated). However, in
     order to make sense of my activity of deliberation, I have to assume that my
     activity matters with respect to its result and that it isn’t a foregone
     conclusion what I’m to do (if it were a foregone conclusion then I would’t need
     to deliberate). So it seems that I need to presuppose my freedom to make sense
     “from the inside” of my activity of deliberation when I deliberate, even if in
     actuality I was never free at any point. In this sense the practical question of
     what I ought to believe or do is independent of the metaphysical (or speculative
     theoretical) question of what is really the case (or at least so Korsgaard has
     argued). We’ll look at this kind of reading of Kant in much more detail in
     week 6. 
   
**** Eunhong
- How are natural causation and freedom supposed to be compatible?
   + I talked around this in seminar but didn’t quite get all the way to discussing
     it. Kant’s view is that if time were fundamentally real then reality would be deterministically temporally structured and we could not be free/responsible. However, if his transcendental idealism is true, then space and time are not fundamentally real, but only ways in which what is real must appear to beings like us (i.e. as creatures with what he calls ‘forms of sensibility’). Since time is no longer an independent feature of reality, it is logically/epistemically possible that reality is structured in some other non-temporal causal way. This means that it is logically/epistemically possible that we could act as absolutely spontaneous causes. This is thus the sense in which Kant combines freedom and (pre-)determinism. There is determinism at the level of the objects of experience (whose ontological status depends in some sense “on us”) and, at least the possibility of, freedom at the level of things as they really are “in themselves”, i.e. things whose existence and nature don’t in any sense depend on our forms of sensibility (or our mind more generally).

**** Chen
- In what sense does Kant think there is a universal morality (case of elders in the mountains)?
   + Kant thinks that moral demands or requirements are all the “demands” that reason
     makes on finite rational beings. But that is just to say that if we were all
     rational then we would just act in the way that reason describes. In that sense,
     all moral requirements are requirements of rational beings, insofar as they are
     rational. Another way of putting this is that there cannot be a reason for me to
     \phi or \neg\phi that is not (in relevantly similar contexts) also a reason for you to \phi
     or \neg\phi. The universality of such reasons is not due to what you or I or society
     at large /decides/ or otherwise agrees to, but due to the nature of reason itself.
     So in Kant’s view there are going to be right and wrong answers about what
     morality requires, and these answers are right and wrong even if some people at
     some time or place act differently.

    Regarding the action-guiding nature of Kant’s conception of the categorical
    imperative, there’s a lot to say here both for and against. But I take one way
    of reading Kant’s discussion of the formula of the imperative as a universal law
    or law of nature and the ‘universalization’ procedure or thought experiment,
    universalization concerns a necessary constraint on moral ‘maxims’ (i.e.
    principles for action) that they not contradict themselves either in conception
    or practice. However, lack of contradiction is not /sufficient/ for a maxim’s
    status as moral. So even if it were true that there is no contradiction in the
    proposed example of society whose elderly go to die in the mountains, it could
    nevertheless still be true that maxims to act in such ways are morally
    wrong/defective for some further reason (e.g. for reasons stated by the third
    version of the moral law as valuing humanity, or the fourth version regarding
    membership in a “kingdom of ends”). 

**** John
1. How are we to understand the relationship between Freedom and Choice when one is not conceived as temporally grounded and the other is? I think I am having a little difficulty imagining how these two concepts of spontaneity are to be both causally relevant but not both temporally construable.
    + We didn’t really get into this issue in class, but Kant makes a distinction
      between the “will” (/Wille/) and the power of choice (/Willkür/). The power of
      choice brings about, or makes actual, some object or state of affairs through
      its exercise. The will is the principle by which the power of choice operates.
      Kant often however just speaks of “the will” without making this distinction. In
      any case, one’s choice is free just in the case that one chooses according to
      rational principles, and the capacity to choose (or the power of choice) is free
      just in case one can choose according to rational principles and is necessitated
      by sensible impulses. Since Kant strictly distinguishes between sensible
      impulses and rational causes, the only way one can choose freely is if one’s
      power of choice can be determined by a non-temporal causal ground, which in
      Kant’s view would be practical reason. 
2. Second, somewhere in the readings I got a sense that Choice seems to be exemplified
   as a power. If it were a power, could it be that it co-exists with other “powers”?
   I feel like this is not Kantian. But if Kant does in fact affirm the force of
   sensory impulses on Choice, then it sounds like there are competing powers at play
   in the human psyche…[and then what exactly is the question]?
    + As discussed in seminar this is exactly the right way to think about Kant’s
      view. He makes some clear statements to this effect at the beginning of the
      Dialectic in the /Critique of Pure Reason/. There he says

      #+begin_quote
      No force of nature can of itself depart from its own laws. Hence neither the
      understanding by itself (without the influence of another cause), nor the senses
      by themselves, can err; the first cannot, because while it acts merely according
      to its own laws, its effect (the judgment) must necessarily agree with these laws
      (Transcendental illusion, A294/B350; see also JL 9:53-4, /Wiener/ /Logik/ 24:824-5, /Refl./ 
      R2142 16:250 (1776-1781))
      #+end_quote

      Kant construes error as the result of the deviation of a capacity’s activity from its characteristic laws in a kind of “geometry of error”, and which, since the issue is always one of causality, must be construed in terms of the causal interaction of different capacities upon one another.32  As he puts it in the Vienna Logic:

      #+begin_quote
      Error is neither in the understanding alone, then, nor in the senses alone; instead,
      it always lies in the influence of the senses on the understanding, when we do not
      distinguish well the inﬂuence of sensibility on the understanding. (24:825)
      #+end_quote
     
      Hence errors in thinking—i.e. the use of the capacities of understanding and judgment—arise as a product of the influence of sensibility on the intellect. More generally, the laws constitutive of the intellect produce particular effects unless interfered with by some external or ‘alien’ causal power.

**** Janelle
I think we answered Janelle’s question in seminar. To reiterate, Kant’s view seems to
be that rational beings are responsible, even if they act in habitually vicious ways,
since they nevertheless have a capacity to do the right/rational thing. Whether this
position is fully defensible is another story. 
*** General Comments
**** Why ‘Transcendental’ Freedom?
- 'transcendental' usually means ‘condition of the possibility of’; so here we can
  think of it as designating the conditions of imputation 
**** What is the relation between T and P freedom?
- It isn’t really clear why T freedom is presupposed by P freedom. Seems like they
  are really just independent of each other. Perhaps Kant’s idea is that what we are
  interested in are beings capable of rationally structuring/shaping their lives in a way
  such that the choices they make in such structuring are imputable to them. So the
  whole discussion runs through the notion of imputation/authorship of action

This is the homepage for *PHIL 971* – Kantian Conceptions of Rational Agency

Kant famously considers moral agency to consist in acting from a grasp of rational
principles as such. But what is a rational principle and what is it to act from such
a principle? In this seminar we'll look at how Kant answers these questions, and
evaluate the theory of rational agency that results. We'll also look at the reception
of Kant's position in contemporary Anglophone philosophy, particularly in the work of
Frankfurt, Korsgaard, Velleman, Reath, and Herman. Some related questions we'll be
trying to find answers to include:

- How does Kant conceive of the connection between rational action and free action? 
- What kind of metaphysical commitments does Kant build into his conception of
  rational action? Do any of these commitments seem plausible today? 
- What is the importance of the capacity for self-consciousness with respect to being rational?

This week we’ll go over the basic structure and themes of the course and then sketch
Kant’s view of agency. We start with a question: some conditions that an agent may be
in are rationally determinable. Others are not. How should we understand this
difference? More generally, how should we understand the notion of rationality, and
relatedly, of engaging in rational activity? We’ll look at Ram Neta’s setup of this
issue, before turning to Kant’s.

We’ll spend the rest of the meeting looking at some of Kant’s basic metaphysical
commitments regarding agency, specifically his conception of causation and the way in
which he construes an agent as a substance with causal powers to effect change in
itself or other beings.

Last week we started talking about Kant’s conception of free action. This week we’ll
try and get clearer as to the notion of ‘control’ that lies behind this conception of
free action. In terms of readings from Kant we’ll be focusing on much of the same
material from last week plus a few other things. 

I want to focus our discussion around the following questions:

1. Is Kant’s conception of absolute spontaneity made more intelligible by appeal to
   his view of control? 
2. What is the connection, for Kant, between control and responsibiilty?
3. Does control require choice?
4. If rational acts are all and only those that are under one’s control, and control
   is dependent on choice how does Kant avoid (if he does) an implausibly
   voluntaristic position?

We’ll finish up our discussion of control and time this week. We then move on to look
at how Kant conceives of the freedom of the rational subject (in all its metaphysical
demandingness) includes even the activity of making inferences. We’ll discuss various
issues surrounding Kant’s conception of inference, and why he thinks it is so
metaphysically demanding. I’ve also linked two recent articles. The first, by Ram
Neta, on the “basing relation”, has a variety of points of connection with Kant’s own
view. The second, by Paul Boghossian, is on the “taking condition” more generally as
an account of inference.

[[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant/][Immanuel Kant]] (1724--1804) was the most significant German philosopher of the
eighteenth century, and was a key figure in the [[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant/][Enlightenment]]. He wrote most
of his most famous philosophical works relatively late in his professional
life, having only achieved a permanent position as professor in 1770, at the
age of forty-six. From 1781 to 1798 Kant published a series of tremendously
influential philosophical works, including the /Critique of Pure Reason/
(1781/​7), the /Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals/ (1785), the /Metaphysical
Foundations of Natural Science/ (1786), the /Critique of Practical Reason/
(1788), and the /Critique of the Power of Judgment/ (1790).

We'll be primarily focusing on Kant's project in the /Critique of Pure Reason/,
as well as the moral philosophy of the /Groundwork for the Metaphysics of
Morals/ and the /Critique of Practical Reason/. There are certain aspects of
Kant's project in the /Critique of Pure Reason/ that should be very familiar to
those with knowledge of prominent European philosophers of the 17th and 18th
centuries. For example, like Descartes, Locke, and Hume, Kant wishes to
articulate the nature and extent of human knowledge, and to do so in a manner
which proceeds from an analysis of the nature of human cognitive capacities.
Kant believes that human reason requires a ‘critique'---a kind of process of
self-examination or scrutiny---as to whether it is fit to provide us with
knowledge. Kant ultimately argues that human reason is not fit to provide us
with knowledge of a mind-independent reality transcending human experience. In
this sense Kant is deeply sympathetic with ‘empiricist' critiques by Locke,
Berkeley, and Hume of ‘rationalist' philosophers such as Descartes and
Leibniz.

However, Kant also argues that we have much deeper and more extensive
knowledge of the world we experience (or could possibly experience) than his
empiricist predecessors would allow. For example, Kant argues that we have
knowledge of necessary truths concerning aspects of the empirical world (such
as that every event in the empirical world has a cause), as well as truths
which are universal in scope or extent. Thus Kant articulates a view that is
directly opposed to the kinds of skeptical arguments Hume discusses in his
/Treatise/ and first /Enquiry/.

Kant thus thinks that we have knowledge of the necessary and universal laws
governing the empirical world---or more simple, "nature"---while he
nevertheless argues that we are almost wholly ignorant of the fundamental
reality which underlies or grounds the existence of the natural world. In
this way Kant combines various aspects of both the traditional rationalist and
empiricist positions. Like Locke and Hume, Kant thinks we must realize that
the boundaries of human knowledge stop at experience, and thus that we must be
extraordinarily circumspect concerning any claim made about what reality is
like independent of all human experience. But, like Descartes and Leibniz,
Kant thinks that central parts of human knowledge nevertheless exhibit
characteristics of necessity and universality, and that, contrary to Hume's
skeptical arguments, we can have good reason to think that they do.

Kant thus critiques pure reason in order to show its nature and limits, and
thereby curb the pretensions of various metaphysical systems articulated on
the basis of a firm faith that reason alone allows us to scrutinize the very
depths of reality. But Kant also argues that the legitimate domain of reason
is more extensive and more substantive than previous empiricist critiques had
allowed. In this way Kant salvages much of the prevailing Enlightenment
conception of reason as an organ for knowledge of the world.

Below I characterize some of the central aspects of Kant's epistemological
framework and how that framework significantly revolutionized our
understanding of the possible nature and extent of human knowledge.

**** Human Knowledge

***** The A Priori

A variety of philosophers from the Early Modern period (e.g. Descartes,
Leibniz, Hume) argue that there are kinds of knowledge that may be had just by
thinking, and that such forms of knowledge are universal and necessary in
scope. Hume's conception of knowledge made this especially clear. According to
Hume, knowledge of necessary and universal truths must be purely a function of
knowledge of the relations of ideas.

Kant agrees with Hume that a priori knowledge is independent of experience. In
fact, he sees it as definitive of 'pure' a priori knowledge that it be
completely independent of experience in the sense that its content is neither
derived from experience not justified by experience in its application. He
contrasts such knowledge with 'empirical' knowledge or knowledge a posteriori.
A priori knowledge may be more or less 'pure' according to whether or not the
concepts which make it up are themselves a priori knowable. Kant uses the
example 'every alteration has a cause' as an example of /impure/ a priori
knowledge, since the concept <alteration> is empirical.

One important point about Kant's use of 'independent' in describing the a
priori. Kant does not think that a priori knowledge is independent of
experience in the sense that one need not have /any/ experience in order to have
knowledge. On the contrary, Kant thinks that /all/ of our knowledge depends on
our having experience of some kind or another, though he doesn't think this
dependence entails that all our judgments are ultimately /justified/ by
experience. This is why Kant says that

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  But although all our cognition commences with experience, yet it does
  not on that account all arise from experience. (CPR B1)
#+END_QUOTE

There seems to be two reasons for Kant's thinking this. First, we need
experience in order for our cognitive faculties to function and develop.
Second, we may need particular experiences in order to acquire empirical
concepts (e.g. red experiences in order to acquire the concept <red>). This is
what distinguishes pure from impure a priori judgments. Impure a priori
judgments are partially constituted by concepts whose content is in some way
derived from content given by the senses.

If a priori knowledge is, for Kant, knowledge that is (in some sense to
be further specified) /independent/ of experience, that fact is not the
only mark or indicator that some bit of knowledge is a priori. In
addition, Kant argues, any bit of knowledge that is necessary and/or
universal in scope is itself a priori.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Necessity and strict universality are therefore secure indications" of
  an a priori cognition, and also belong together inseparably. But since
  in their use it is sometimes easier to show the empirical limitation
  in judgments than the contingency in them, or is often more plausible
  to show the unrestricted universality that we ascribe to a judgment
  than its necessity, it is advisable to employ separately these two
  criteria, each of which is in itself infallible. (CPR B4)
#+END_QUOTE
  

Kant argues that this conception of a priori knowledge is presupposed in many
empirical judgments as well as in particular sciences. He specifically points
to mathematics ('5+7=12') and to physical judgments ('every alteration has a
cause'). One of Kant's arguments against Humean skepticism is that all of our
empirical knowledge (even that knowledge which we think we have
unproblematically) presupposes a priori knowledge, which itself requires that
there be legitimate use of pure a priori concepts (i.e. concepts which cannot be
derived from any sense impression).

Kant thinks that there are many examples of judgments which we claim to know a
priori, but he is interested primarily in a specific subset of those which
constitute the subject matter of /metaphysics/---viz. judgments concerning God,
the soul (or mind), and immortality. One of Kant's primary aims is to
determine whether metaphysical knowledge is possible, and if it is possible,
what the extent and nature of that knowledge might be. This is what it means
when Kant says that he wishes to set metaphysics "on the secure path of a
science" (e.g. Bxvi). Metaphysical knowledge is problematic, Kant argues,
because unlike other forms of a priori knowledge, such as logic and
mathematics, it is not at all obvious which metaphysical judgments are in fact
correct and thus known, and which are merely thought to be so. This is
exemplified, Kant thinks, by the contentious disputes in which philosophers
have long been involved. Kant provides the following memorable description of
the sad plight of metaphysics. 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In metaphysics we have to retrace our path countless times, because we find
that it does not lead where we want to go, and it is so far from reaching
unanimity in the assertions of its adherents that it is rather a battlefield,
and indeed one that appears to be especially determined for testing one's
powers in mock combat; on this battlefield no combatant has ever gained the
least bit of ground, nor has any been able to base any lasting possession on
his victory. Hence there is no doubt that up to now the procedure of
metaphysics has been a mere groping, and what is the worst, a groping among
mere concepts. (Bxiv-xiv)
#+END_QUOTE 

Kant thus hopes that, by giving a critique of reason, he can demonstrate the
extent to which metaphysics might count as a science. As a secure science it
would rest on a secure set of claims and no longer be a "groping among mere
concepts."

***** The Analytic/Synthetic Distinction

A judgment is known (or knowable) a priori if it is known (or knowable)
independently of experience. Kant thinks that this is not the only dimension
according to which one can analyze a judgment. Kant also argues that all
judgments, in addition to being classifiable as either a priori or a
posteriori (or empirical), may also be classified as being either [[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/analytic-synthetic/][analytic or
synthetic]].

An analytic judgment is one in which the predicate is ‘contained' in the
concept. One way of understanding this notion of ‘containment' is via a claim
about meaning. Accordingly, analytic judgments are those whose truth is known
merely in virtue of knowing the meaning or content of the concepts
constituting the judgment. For example, in the judgment ‘All bachelors are
unmarried' the concept <unmarried> is part of the meaning of <bachelor> and so
the truth of the judgment is grasped just by knowing the relevant meanings or
contents of its component concepts.

Kant also introduces several other markers of analyticity. In total Kant
provides us with four different marks of analyticity. He says that in an
analytic judgment the predicate is

1. ‘contained' within the subject
2. ‘identical' with the subject
3. analytic judgments are ones which are ‘explicative' rather than
   ‘ampliative'
4. analytic judgments are those knowable by means of application of the
   principle of non-contradiction

Which, if any of these markers is best thought of as the main characteristic
of an analytic judgment? This is a disputed issue (cf. @anderson2005;
@proops2005), though certainly, in all cases Kant is thinking of ‘atomic'
judgments of subject-predicate form.

***** The Synthetic A Priori

Kant argues, in ways similar to Locke, Hume, and Leibniz, that analytic
judgments are knowable a priori. Staying with the ‘containment' metaphor,
since the predicate is contained in the subject of an analytic judgment, there
is no need to look beyond the judgment to the world (so to speak) in order to
determine the truth value of the judgment. In this Kant is obviously in
agreement with Locke, Hume, and Leibniz. Kant agrees with his empiricist
predecessors in claiming that all a posteriori judgments are synthetic. Since
the predicate is adding something new to the subject we must look beyond the
judgment to the world---what we can experience---in order that we might
determine the relevant judgments truth or falsity. In non-empirical cases
(like the bachelor example above) the judgment's truth is determined by the
meanings of the concepts constituting it.

Kant's main innovation to the a priori/posteriori and analytic/synthetic
schemas is to note that the analytic a priori and the synthetic a posteriori
do not necessarily exhaust the realm of possible judgments. Here he
essentially can be understood to deny that "Hume's Fork" is an adequate
representation of the structure of human knowledge. According to Kant, there
are also /synthetic a priori/ judgments that are possible. Kant argues that
causal judgments are a clear example.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  it is easy to show that in human cognition there actually are such
  necessary and in the strictest sense universal, thus pure a priori
  judgments. If one wants an example from the sciences, one need only
  look at all the propositions of mathematics; if one would have one
  from the commonest use of the understanding, the proposition that
  every alteration must have a cause will do; indeed in the latter the
  very concept of a cause so obviously contains the concept of a
  necessity of connection with an effect and a strict universality of
  rule that it would be entirely lost if one sought, as Hume did, to
  derive it from a frequent association of that which happens with that
  which precedes and a habit (thus a merely subjective necessity) of
  connecting representations arising from that association (CPR B4-5)
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Take the proposition: "Everything that happens has its cause." In the
  concept of something that happens, I think, to be sure, of an
  existence that was preceded by a time, etc., and from that analytic
  judgments can be drawn. But the concept of a cause lies entirely
  outside that concept, and indicates something different than the
  concept of what happens in general, and is therefore not contained in
  the latter representation at all. How then do I come to say something
  quite different about that which happens in general, and to cognize
  the concept of cause as belonging to it, indeed necessarily, even
  though not contained in it? What is the unknown=X here on which the
  understanding depends when it believes itself to discover beyond the
  concept of A a predicate that is foreign to it yet which it
  nevertheless believes to be connected with it? (CPR B13-14)
#+END_QUOTE

Kant argues here that our judgments concerning events presuppose that they do
not just /occur/ but are /caused to occur/, that we know this to be true
necessarily and universally, and that we have no explanation of this fact
unless the judgments we make in such cases are synthetic a priori judgments.
The question remains, however, just how such synthetic a priori judgments
could be possibly true, much less known to be so. What is it that could link
the concepts in a subject-predicate judgment such that the truth of the
judgment holds necessarily and universally, while its nevertheless being true
that the predicate is not contained in the subject of the judgment, and thus
that the judgment is not analytic?

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Now the entire final aim of our speculative a priori cognition rests
  on such synthetic, i.e., ampliative principles; for the analytic ones
  are, to be sure, most important and necessary, but only for
  attaining that distinctness of concepts which is requisite for a
  secure and extended synthesis as a really new acquisition (CPR B13-14)
#+END_QUOTE

Kant argues that we need to explain how synthetic a priori judgments are
possible, and that the explanation of the possibility of significant portions
of our knowledge rests on this, including mathematics and natural science, as
well as the very possibility of metaphysics.

***** Mathematics and the Synthetic A Priori

Recall that for Hume, mathematical knowledge was a function merely of
knowledge of relations of ideas, in other words, that math is analytic
and a priori. Kant disputes this. Our mathematical knowledge is
certainly a priori, he thinks, but it is not explained in terms of
relations of ideas or concepts (i.e. in terms of containment or any of
the other marks of analyticity). Instead, Kant argues that mathematical
knowledge must be /synthetic/, but since it is necessary and universal,
also /a priori/. Here's how Kant puts the point in his /Prolegomena/:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  The essential feature of pure mathematical cognition, differentiating
  it from all other a priori cognition, is that it must throughout
  proceed not from concepts, but always and only through the
  construction of concepts (Critique, p. 713). Because pure mathematical
  cognition, in its propositions, must therefore go beyond the concept
  to that which is contained in the intuition corresponding to it, its
  propositions can and must never arise through the analysis of
  concepts, i.e., analytically, and so are one and all synthetic.
  (/Prolegomena/ 4:272, p. 20)
#+END_QUOTE

Kant uses two examples in his argument concerning mathematics. The first
is the judgment '7+5=12' and the second is the geometric judgment that
'the shortest distance between two points is a straight line'. Though
both judgments are knowable a priori, Kant thinks that in neither of
these two cases can we explain the truth of the judgments analytically.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  One might well at first think: that the proposition 7 + 5 = 12 is a
  purely analytic proposition that follows from the concept of a sum of
  seven and five according to the principle of contradiction. However,
  upon closer inspection, one finds that the concept of the sum of 7 and
  5 contains nothing further than the unification of the two numbers
  into one, through which by no means is thought what this single number
  may be that combines the two. The concept of twelve is in no way
  already thought because I merely think to myself this unification of
  seven and five, and I may analyze my concept of such a possible sum
  for as long as may be, still I will not meet with twelve therein.
  (/Prolegomena/ 4:268-9, p. 18)
#+END_QUOTE

Kant's argument here is that while it might be analytically true that
the sum of 7 and 5 is /a number/ (and also that it must be a /natural
number/), it is not clear from analysis alone that the sum is equal to
12, or any other pair of natural numbers which might sum to 12.

Kant seems to think that to the extent one finds the answer twelve
/obvious/ one is adverting, either explicitly or implicitly, to some
particular experience of adding units, such as counting on one's
fingers, or adding up objects (e.g. apples, chairs, blocks, etc.).

Also, if '7+5=12' is known analytically, then in thinking it one is
equivalently thinking of any or all the numbers which are equal to 12,
including /very large/ numbers (e.g. any numbers /m/ and /n/ which might yield 12).
This certainly doesn't reflect our experience when calculating such sums,
which may yield further evidence that the judgment isn't analytically true.

**** The Copernican Turn

In a famous passage in the second edition of the /Critique of Pure Reason/ Kant
makes an analogy between the strategy pursued by his critical philosophy and
the central contribution of Nicolas Copernicus.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Up to now it has been assumed that all our cognition must conform to
  the objects; but all attempts to find out something about them a
  priori through concepts that would extend our cognition have, on this
  presupposition, come to nothing. Hence let us once try whether we do
  not get farther with the problems of metaphysics by assuming that the
  objects must conform to our cognition, which would agree better with
  the requested possibility of an a priori cognition of them, which is
  to establish something about objects before they are given to us. This
  would be just like the first thoughts of Copernicus, who, when he did
  not make good progress in the explanation of the celestial motions if
  he assumed that the entire celestial host revolves around the
  observer, tried to see if he might not have greater success if he made
  the observer revolve and left the stars at rest. Now in metaphysics we
  can try in a similar way regarding the intuition of objects. (CPR
  Preface, Bxvi-xvii)
#+END_QUOTE

So just as Copernicus sought to explain the apparent motions of objects
in the heavens in terms of the movement of the earthbound observer, so
too Kant attempts to account for the apparent characteristics of objects
in terms of our cognitive faculties and the cognitive conditions under
which we know the objective world. In Kantian phrase, instead of
assuming that our knowledge of the object must conform to /it/, we
assume that it conforms to /our knowledge/.

**** Transcendental Idealism

Kant's name for the position he articulates according to which objects
must conform to our way of knowing them is ‘Transcendental Idealism.'
Though the exact meaning of Transcendental Idealism is much disputed by
Kant's interpreters, it is clear that he intends at least two things by
it.

First, according to Transcendental Idealism, space and time are neither
independent subsisting entities (as was suggested by Newton), nor
object-dependent orders of relations between entities (as was argued by
Leibniz). Instead, they are mind-dependent 'forms of intuition.' They are thus
understood in terms of the characteristic ways in which we experience things
rather than either being mind-independent things that we experience, or
relations between mind-independent things that we experience. Kant argues that
space and time are nevertheless 'empirically real' --- they are fundamental
features of the empirical world that we experience. But they are not real ‘in
themselves.' They have no ultimate reality apart from our capacity for
experience.

Second, in addition to the transcendental ideality of space and time, to
which all experienced objects must conform, Kant argues that empirical
reality is itself further structured by a privileged set of a priori concepts.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  experience itself is a kind of cognition requiring the understanding,
  whose rule I have to presuppose in myself before any object is given
  to me, hence a priori, which rule is expressed in concepts a priori,
  to which all objects of experience must therefore necessarily conform,
  and with which they must agree. As for objects insofar as they are
  thought merely through reason, and necessarily at that, but that (at
  least as reason thinks them) cannot be given in experience at all -
  the attempt to think them (for they must be capable of being thought)
  will provide a splendid touchstone of what we assume as the altered
  method of our way of thinking, namely that we can cognize of things a
  priori only what we ourselves have put into them (CPR Preface,
  Bxvii-xviii)
#+END_QUOTE

Kant here argues that the object which appear to one in perceptual
experience, or ‘intuition' as he calls it, also must conform to our
basic conceptual scheme. He explains what he means here in the last
sentence: objects must conform to our conceptual scheme because that
scheme makes possible the experience of such objects.

Though elements of Kant's ‘Copernican' strategy remain unclear,
the basic idea is that Kant argues that what makes synthetic a priori
knowledge possible is the structure of our cognitive faculties,
including the pure forms of intuition and a privileged set of a priori
concepts. These forms and concepts jointly make experience possible and
allow us to draw inferences that hold with necessity and universality
concerning objects encountered in experience. What's more, Kant argues
that because a priori concepts are necessary for experience in general,
we can know that those concepts are applied legitimately, since he is
taking it as obvious that we have experience.

**** The Analogies   
Kant entitles the section of the System of All Principles discussing the relational categories the "Analogies of Experience." Kant discusses the category of /cause/ in the second of his three ‘Analogies'. The Analogies are part of the ‘Analytic of Principles' in which Kant discusses each of the twelve categories and their relation to the objects of experience at much greater length than he does in the argument of the Transcendental Deduction, where he is concerned with the categories' general relation to objects of experience. Before we go on to discuss Kant's view of causality in detail let's start with a few background issues. First, what does Kant mean here by an "analogy"?

Kant distinguishes between analogy in mathematics and analogy in philosophy (B221) and defines analogy in philosophy as

#+begin_quote
not the identity of two *quantitative* [relations, as in mathematical analogy] but [the identity] of two *qualitative* relations, where from three given members I can cognize and give /a priori/ only the *relation* to a fourth member but not *this* fourth *member* itself, although I have a rule for seeking it in experience and a mark for discovering it there (B222)
#+end_quote

It is not clear from this remark what the fundamental difference is between
mathematical and philosophical analogy.[fn:2] He goes on to say that

#+begin_quote
An analogy of experience will therefore be only a rule in accordance with which unity of experience is to arise from perceptions (not as a perception itself, as empirical intuition in general), and as a principle it will not be valid of the objects (of the appearances) *constitutively* but merely *regulatively*. (B222)
#+end_quote

Though Kant's position here is complicated, and interpretations contested, at least this much is clear. First, the paragraph immediately above points out that the relational categories are not constitutive of appearances, intuition, or the perception thereof. That is, they are not the conditions of the possibility of such representations. Instead they are constitutive only of experience, insofar as it can be constructed from the connected series of intuitions in a perception. Second, that there is supposed to be a general structure to the analogies such that a is to b as c is to /x/, where /x/ is that which is to be sought in an experience.

Fortunately, for our purposes, we need not have an exact conception of what an analogy is to appreciate the basic points of his argument in the Second Analogy. But we do need to understand the exact relation between the category <cause-effect> and the representation of time.

Kant distinguishes three different kinds of temporality (B219): persistence, succession, and simultaneity. He then claims that each kind of temporality is connected with each of the relational categories (i.e. persistence with <substance-inherence>, succession with <cause-effect>, and simultaneity with <community>).  

Kant therefore prefaces his discussion of the three Analogies of Experience with a single principle, which, in the first edition, reads: “As regards their existence, all appearances stand a priori under rules of the determination of their relation to each other in one time” (A176) and in the second, reads: “Experience is possible only through the representation of a necessary connection of perceptions” (B218). The basic idea here is that each of the three relational categories represents a necessary connection that is required for the possibility of /experience/ (not intuition or perception!) of (i) a single time and (ii) of objects existing and being temporally related to each other within a single time.

Two further points of background are worth discussing before proceeding to the Second Analogy itself. First, Kant denies that we can perceive time itself (B219), which is to say that Kant denies that we have conscious awareness of /time/, as opposed to the persistence, succession, or simultaneity of representations that occur /in/ time.

Second, Kant assumes a distinction between an objective temporal order between states of objects (and between objects) and the subjective temporal appearance of such order, construed merely as the subjective succession of representations in a particular empirical mind. Much of Kant's discussion is then aimed at answering the question "how do I manage to cognize and know anything about an objective temporal order if all I have access to is the subjective temporal succession of my own representations?"

[fn:2] See [@callanan2008] for extensive discussion and citations. 


**** The Second Analogy

The Second Analogy concerns the /cause-effect/ relation. The "unschematized" (i.e. the "pure" and non-temporal) version of the category says that given the existence of some ground, its consequence necessarily exists. But this says nothing further about the relata, the relation between ground and consequence, or the nature of the relation of necessity that holds between them. In the Second Analogy we see the schematized version of the category, and thus the elaboration of the necessary relation as a /temporal/ one. He states this as follows:

#+begin_quote
  All alterations occur in accordance with the law of the connection of cause
  and effect (B232)
#+end_quote

In other words, all alterations occur lawfully, such that all alterations occur due to causes from which they necessarily follow. 

What is an "alteration"? Kant says that "the concept of alteration presupposes one and the same subject as existing with two opposed determinations, and thus as persisting" (B233). This indicates that Kant is primarily concerned with a change of state in a substance. An alteration is the change of a substance from one state (or the possession of a property) to another, e.g. from hot to cold, thin to fat, black to white, etc. Kant thus seeks to validate the principle that there can be no alteration in a substance that is not due to some cause.   

Kant conceives of all change in terms of alteration. So the Second Analogy ends up being an argument concerned with our ability to cognize change with respect to the objects of experience. Kant's view is that all change with respect to such objects must be understood temporally, and as requiring that the change be the effect of some cause. 

One issue related to this way of setting up the problem of causation is that it is unclear whether the success of the Second Analogy is supposed to show that no alteration takes place except as the result of /some/ cause, or that no alteration takes place except as the result of the /same type/ of cause. The phrasing of the principle supports only the first, weaker reading, but lawful causation is often taken to require that the same type of cause always yields the same type of effect (e.g. fire causes heat). 

A further issue is whether the argument Kant presents for the causal principle ends up being one that engages in any way with Hume's skeptical position concerning causation. Recall that according to Hume we have no impression of necessary connection, and so there cannot be any legitimacy to the use of the concept of necessary connection in our experience of objects. For Hume, casual judgments are the result of being habituated to expect the occurrence of one event given the occurrence of another (e.g. to expect that heat will accompany fire). 

***** The Argument

Much of Kant's argument in the Second Analogy proceeds by way of the following starting point or assumption: We are able to represent (and ultimately come to know) the difference between the subjective succession or simultaneity of our own states, and the objective succession or simultaneity of states in an object. How is this so much as possible?

Understanding Kant's argument in this way suggests that he is engaged in a manner of argumentation that we've termed a "transcendental" argument. That is, an argument that starts from an assumption concerning some actual phenomenon and regresses to the conditions of that actual phenomenon's possibility. Kant provides two examples to motivate this assumption, that of the visual experience of (the parts of) a house, and the experience of a ship moving downriver. We distinguish the representation of a persisting object, such as a house, from a series of events, such as a ship moving downriver. But in both cases there is no difference subjectively in what occurs (at least at a certain level of abstraction), namely a succession of subjective perceptions. As Kant says,

#+begin_quote
The apprehension of the manifold of appearance is always successive. The representations of the parts succeed one another. Whether they also succeed in the object is a second point for reflection, which is not contained in the first (B234)
#+end_quote

So how is it that we can distinguish in the ship case that we have an objective /succession/ of events, while in the house case we have objective /simultaneity/---one persisting object, whose parts (e.g. roof, walls, windows, etc.) we perceive successively but are in fact simultaneous?

Kant rules out several possibilities. We can't distinguish objective succession from objective simultaneity by the intuition or perception of any necessary connection because (and here Kant agrees with Hume) experience “to be sure tells us what is, but not that it must necessarily be so and not otherwise” (B3). Second, the supposed irreversibility of our perception of successive events (such as with the riverboat case) cannot tell us anything because one can only be aware of the relevant contrast between 'reversible' and 'irreversible' perceptions if one is /already/ aware that there is an irreversible order (e.g. that B's following A and not vice versa) to what one is perceiving, such that one's perceptions must be in accord with it. Third, one cannot appeal to some independently perceivable temporal succession (‘absolute' time), because Kant has already ruled out the possibility of perceiving time itself (B 245). Fourth, one cannot appeal to the perception of any mind-independent object (a ‘thing in itself'), since these too have been ruled out as wholly inaccessible to our conscious awareness.

So Kant has issued a challenge: granted that a subject of experience has a grasp of the distinction between objective succession of alterations in an object (e.g. in the motion of a ship downstream) and the objective simultaneity of the features of an object (e.g. the various features of a house), what account for such awareness? This is a problem for the Humean as well, since that view presupposes that we at least sometimes make causal judgments based on a grasp of a determinate temporal sequence (i.e. of some event B following event A).[fn:57] Hence the Humean account of habituation and causal judgment presupposes that we can distinguish the objective sequence of events from our subjective train of sense experiences.

Kant's claim then, is that it is only if there is a rule ordering our representations, such that what makes it possible for us to grasp two events as related by objective temporal succession is that one event /caused/ the other. Here is a reconstruction of the whole argument, as articulated by Georges Dicker (@dicker2004, 173).

1. We cannot know by observation that an event---that is, a transition from a state A to a state B---is occurring by knowing that the perceptions of A and B occur in the order A, B; by knowing that the perceptions of A and B are irreversible; by knowing that A precedes B by reference to absolute time; or by knowing that these perceptions are of successive states of things-in-themselves.
2. If (1), then the only way we can know by perception that an event---that
   is, a transition from a state A to a state B---is occurring is by knowing
   that B follows A according to a rule, that is, that the event has a cause.
3. If the only way we can know by perception that an event---that is, a
   transition from a state A to a state B---is occurring is by knowing that B
   follows A according to a rule, that is, that the event has a cause, then
   any event such that we can know of its occurrence by perception must have a
   cause.
4. \therefore Any event such that we can know of its occurrence by perception must
   have a cause.

Kant's conclusion here is limited in several ways. First, it concerns only knowledge that empirical events have causes. It does not say, e.g., that similar events always have similar causes. Second, it presupposes that we have knowledge of the objective succession of events. Third, it presupposes that we correctly grasp the distinction between objective succession and objective simultaneity. But, despite these presuppositions, the argument seems an effective answer to the Humean, for the Humean analysis of causation requires that we have a grasp of objective succession (as well as the distinction between objective simultaneity and succession), for this is used by the Humean to explain how our associative powers get their grip on causal judgment. Hence, while Kant's argument concerning causation may not be effective against all comers, particularly against the skeptic who might deny that we have any cognitive grasp of objective succession, it nevertheless seems effective against Hume's argument.

[fn:57] Note that Kant's argument doesn't obviously affect a version of the Humean view that regards causal judgment as based on habituation due to there /being/ a temporal order amongst our representations. Kant's argument only affects the more robust view that we must /represent/ the temporal order amongst our representations for causal judgment to occur.
