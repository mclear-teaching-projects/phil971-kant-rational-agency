# What is it to Act Rationally? 

-   **Q**: How should we understand the notion of rational activity, and more broadly, of what it is to be a rational being?
<!-- -   **A**: A rational being is one capable of acting (broadly construed) in light of reasons -->
    
## Rationally Determinable Conditions ##

  A                                                   B
  --------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------
  Intending to go the club                            Having tinnitus
  Knowing that one is 41                              Being 41
  Judging that one is tired                           Feeling tired
  Experiencing the window\'s shattering by the ball   Hearing a crash
  Attending to the evidential ground of a judgment    Having one\'s attention drawn by a loud noise

-   These lists include acts, events, and states of various kinds; Let's use the term
    "condition" to denote any act, event, or state.
-   All of the entries in (A) have (or typically have) a rational basis. This is not
    so for the entries in (B). What explains this difference?[^1] 
-   Why are some conditions such that there can be a rational basis for them, but
    other conditions not? Why are some conditions 'rationally determinable' while
    others are not?
    - Neta talks of RDCs in terms of acting 'in light of' a reason. What does it take
      to act in light of a reason?
    - Rephrasing our initial answer Neta claims that a rational being is one at least
      some of whose conditions can be determined *in light of* reasons rather than
      (at most) merely *for* reasons.

- Common features of RDCs:

    1. Active 
    2. Agency (i.e. 'doings' as opposed to 'happenings')
    3. Fundamental responsibility
    4. Deontic modal status (permission and requirement)
    
- RDCs are activities performed by agents, for which they are ultimately responsible,
  and which are subject to deontic norms of requirement or permissability 
    
## The Kantian Approach ##

- [Kantian approaches]{.smallcaps} are distinctive in requiring that
  self-consciousness be involved (in some sense) in any RDC, such that the following
  condition holds.
  
Self-Consciousness:
:  Necessarily, any being with the capacity for rational determination is a being
   with the capacity for non-observational self-consciousness, and the two capacities
   are non-accidentally linked
  
- [However]{.smallcaps}, there are a variety of different ways of understanding this
  self-consciousness condition, both as to the nature of the self-consciousness
  requirement itself, and as to the fundamentality of the requirement.[^4]

[^4]: The fact that the human being can have the "I" in his representations raises
    him infinitely above all other living beings on earth. Because of this he is a
    *person*, and by virtue of the unity of consciousness through all changes that
    happen to him, one and the same person -- i.e., through rank and dignity an
    entirely different being from things, such as irrational animals, with which one
    can do as one likes [@kant2006a, 15\; 7:127]

  Reflection theories:
  :  RDCs are marked by the role that *reflective* self-consciousness plays in
     bringing about, sustaining, and extinguishing them[^3]

[^3]: our capacity to turn our attention on to our own mental activities is also a
    capacity to distance ourselves from them, and to call them into question. I
    perceive, and I find myself with a powerful impulse to believe. But I back up and
    bring that impulse into view and then I have a certain distance. Now the impulse
    doesn't dominate me and now I have a problem. Shall I believe? Is this perception
    really a *reason* to believe? [@korsgaard1996, 93]

Mesh theories:
:  RDCs are those that stand in the right sort of *non-causal* relation to other
   mental states/acts/etc., such that they "mesh" in an appropriate way
   
- Such instances of proper mesh include
   - Higher-order identification with lower-order volitions (Frankfurt)
   - Harmony between one's evaluative judgments and one's desires (Watson)
   - Reflective endorsement of lower-order states (Korsgaard)
   - Governance of lower-order plans and intentions by a hierarchy of
     self-governing policies of practical reason (Bratman) 
   -  Compatibility of particular desires with the 'master desire' to act in
      accordance with one's reasons (Velleman)
         
- One question we'll try and work out an answer to over the course of the seminar is
  whether Kant himself should be read as advancing some form of a mesh view, or
  whether he has something else in mind in his characterization of rationality
  
- [Claim]{.smallcaps}: For Kant, the rational determinability of one's condition and the
  capacity for self-consciousness are non-accidentally related by a more fundamental
  *causal* capacity, one which explains *both* the capacity for self-consciousness and
  the rational determinability of one's condition
  <!-- - This causality is atemporal and incompatible with temporal determination -->

# Kant's Critical Project #

1.  Set metaphysics on the "secure path of science"
2.  Explain how rational or "proper" science is, in general, possible
3.  Explain how propositions making claims of universality and necessity
    about the empirical world could be known to be true
4.  Explain knowledge of universality & necessity by virtue of knowledge concerning
    our own mental faculties of cognition, desire, and feeling[^9][^8]

[^9]: all human insight is at an end as soon as we have arrived at basic powers or
    basic faculties for there is nothing through which their possibility can be
    conceived, and yet it may not be invented and assumed at one's discretion. (CPrR 5:46-7)


[^8]: there are three faculties of the mind: the faculty of cognition, the faculty of
    feeling pleasure and displeasure, and the faculty of desire. In the Critique *of
    Pure* (theoretical) *Reason*, I found a priori principles for the first of these,
    and in the Critique *of Practical Reason*, a priori principles for the third. I
    tried to find them for the second as well, and though I thought it impossible to
    find such principles, the analysis of the previously mentioned faculties of the
    human mind allowed me to discover a systematicity...This systematicity put me on
    the path to recognizing the three parts of philosophy, each of which has its a
    priori principles, which can be enumerated and for which one can delimit
    precisely the knowledge that may be based on them: theoretical philosophy,
    teleology, and practical philosophy (Letter to Reinhold, C 10:514-15 \[December 28
    and 31, 1787\])
    


-   Kant's strategy is answer (1) and (2) by means of (3), and (3) by (4)


[^1]: All of the items on the left-hand list are conditions that have
    the following property: there can be a reason in light of which the
    agent is in that condition. But none of the items on the right-hand
    list have that property: there can be a reason why the agent suffers
    from tinnitus, or feels tired, but no reason in light of which she
    suffers from tinnitis, or feels tired, etc. I will henceforth use
    the phrase "rationally determinable conditions" to denote all of the
    conditions that go on the left-hand list, i.e., all those conditions
    which are such that there can be a reason in light of which the
    agent is in them. [@neta2018, 289]

## The Agent & Its Powers

Substance: 
:   A metaphysical or 'final' subject in which properties inhere

   - Substances 'substand' in the sense of being subjects of properties
   - Substances 'subsist' or are 'independent', in the sense of not inhering in anything else


Force: 
:   The relation (*respectus*) that a substance bears to the accidents whose existence it causes  

\

Act:
:   The realization of substantial force (through the exercise of a substance's
    causal power(s)) through which some 'accident' (i.e. 'property' or
    'determination') is the effect[^6]

[^6]: Action [*Handeln*] and effect [*Wirkung*] can only be ascribed to substance. Action
    is the determination of the force [Kraft] of a substance as a cause of a certain
    accident [*accidentis*]. Causality [*Causalitas*] is the characteristic of a
    substance insofar as it is considered as the cause of an accident [*accidentis*]
    (*Metaphysik Pölitz* 28:564-5 (1790/1)).

- Kant's basic conception of activity is that of a substance whose causal powers
  allow it to bring about, through an exertion of force, change in itself or another
  being. *Agency* is that causal power of a substance to bring about change in
  oneself or another through (or via) its representations

## Kant's Anatomy of the Rational Mind

- Two Fundamental Mental Capacities: [^5]

[^5]:  Our cognition arises from two basic sources of the mind, of which
    the first is to receive the representations (the receptivity of
    impressions), the second the faculty of cognizing an object through
    these representations (spontaneity of concepts); through the first
    an object is given to us, through the second it is thought in
    relation to that representation (as mere determination of the mind).
    (A50/B74)


Receptivity:
:   Capacity of the mind to receive representations via affection from
    something distinct from itself

Spontaneity:
:   Capacity of the mind to generate representations from itself without
    any external influence

- Three Forms of Mental Activity:

Cognition: 
:   Objective representational capacity that depends on the existence (or reality) of its object 

Desire: 
:   Objective representational capacity that brings about the existence (or reality) of its object 

Feeling: 
:   Non-objective (representational?) capacity to promote or hinder the
    representational acts of the other capacities
