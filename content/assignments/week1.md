This week we’ll go over the basic structure and themes of the course and then sketch
Kant’s view of agency. We start with a question: how should we understand the notion
of rationality, and relatedly, of engaging in rational activity? This course is
structured around one group of broadly ‘Kantian’ answers to this question, according
to which rationality is the capacity to act _in light of_ a reason, rather than merely
acting in a manner that admits of (or not) of _explanation_ by reasons. We’ll look at
Ram Neta’s setup of this issue, before turning to Kant’s.

We’ll spend the rest of the meeting looking at some of Kant’s basic metaphysical
commitments regarding agency, specifically his conception of causation and the way in
which he construes an agent as a substance with causal powers to effect change in
itself or other beings.
