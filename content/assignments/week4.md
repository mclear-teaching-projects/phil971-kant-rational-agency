We’ll finish up our discussion of control and time this week. We then move on to look
at how Kant conceives of the freedom of the rational subject (in all its metaphysical
demandingness) includes even the activity of making inferences. We’ll discuss various
issues surrounding Kant’s conception of inference, and why he thinks it is so
metaphysically demanding. I’ve also linked two recent articles. The first, by Ram
Neta, on the “basing relation”, has a variety of points of connection with
Kant’s own view. The second, by Paul Boghossian, is on the “taking condition” as an
account of inference.
