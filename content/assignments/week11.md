We'll finish up our discussion of criticisms of doxastic agency (Boyle) and
reflection (Hieronymi) before turning to this week's topic, which concerns the
question of whether the capacity for rationality (in some sense) radically changes
one's other capacities (e.g. perception) or whether it is merely one additional
capacity. We'll look at two takes on the issue, one for (Boyle), and one against
(McLear). I also include some related papers as optional readings.


## Readings {#readings}

-   Boyle, "[A Different Kind of Mind?](/materials/readings/boyle-different-mind.pdf)"
    -   This is a useful intro to the basic idea behind the "transformative" view of rationality.
-   Boyle, "[Additive Theories of Rationality](/materials/readings/boyle-rationality.pdf)"
    -   A more technical discussion, linking it up with arguments by McDowell.
-   McLear, "[Rationality: What Difference Does It Make?](/materials/readings/mclear-transformation.pdf)"
    -   I discuss the transformative conception of rationality specifically with respect
        to the interpretation of Kant
-   (Optional) Schafer, "[A System of Rational Faculties: Additive or Transformative?](/materials/readings/schafer-transformative-rationality.pdf)"
    -   An attempt to provide a more modest conception of the "transformation" provided
        by rational capacities
-   (Optional) Conant, "[Why Kant Is Not a Kantian](/materials/readings/conant-layer-cake.pdf)"
    -   An application of the transformative conception to the interpretation of Kant
