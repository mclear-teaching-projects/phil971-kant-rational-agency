## The Copernican Turn

In a famous passage in the second edition of the *Critique of Pure
Reason* Kant makes an analogy between the strategy pursued by his
critical philosophy and the central contribution of Nicolas Copernicus.

> Up to now it has been assumed that all our cognition must conform to
> the objects; but all attempts to find out something about them a
> priori through concepts that would extend our cognition have, on this
> presupposition, come to nothing. Hence let us once try whether we do
> not get farther with the problems of metaphysics by assuming that the
> objects must conform to our cognition, which would agree better with
> the requested possibility of an a priori cognition of them, which is
> to establish something about objects before they are given to us. This
> would be just like the first thoughts of Copernicus, who, when he did
> not make good progress in the explanation of the celestial motions if
> he assumed that the entire celestial host revolves around the
> observer, tried to see if he might not have greater success if he made
> the observer revolve and left the stars at rest. Now in metaphysics we
> can try in a similar way regarding the intuition of objects. (CPR
> Preface, Bxvi-xvii)

So just as Copernicus sought to explain the apparent motions of objects
in the heavens in terms of the movement of the earthbound observer, so
too Kant attempts to account for the apparent characteristics of objects
in terms of our cognitive faculties and the cognitive conditions under
which we know the objective world. In Kantian phrase, instead of
assuming that our knowledge of the object must conform to *it*, we
assume that it conforms to *our knowledge*.

## Transcendental Idealism

Kant's name for the position he articulates according to which objects
must conform to our way of knowing them is 'Transcendental Idealism.'
Though the exact meaning of Transcendental Idealism is much disputed by
Kant's interpreters, it is clear that he intends at least two things by
it.

First, according to Transcendental Idealism, space and time are neither
independent subsisting entities (as was suggested by Newton), nor
object-dependent orders of relations between entities (as was argued by
Leibniz). Instead, they are mind-dependent 'forms of intuition.' They
are thus understood in terms of the characteristic ways in which we
experience things rather than either being mind-independent things that
we experience, or relations between mind-independent things that we
experience. Kant argues that space and time are nevertheless
'empirically real' --- they are fundamental features of the empirical
world that we experience. But they are not real 'in themselves.' They
have no ultimate reality apart from our capacity for experience.

Second, in addition to the transcendental ideality of space and time, to
which all experienced objects must conform, Kant argues that empirical
reality is itself further structured by a privileged set of a priori
concepts.

> experience itself is a kind of cognition requiring the understanding,
> whose rule I have to presuppose in myself before any object is given
> to me, hence a priori, which rule is expressed in concepts a priori,
> to which all objects of experience must therefore necessarily conform,
> and with which they must agree. As for objects insofar as they are
> thought merely through reason, and necessarily at that, but that (at
> least as reason thinks them) cannot be given in experience at all -
> the attempt to think them (for they must be capable of being thought)
> will provide a splendid touchstone of what we assume as the altered
> method of our way of thinking, namely that we can cognize of things a
> priori only what we ourselves have put into them (CPR Preface,
> Bxvii-xviii)

Kant here argues that the object which appear to one in perceptual
experience, or 'intuition' as he calls it, also must conform to our
basic conceptual scheme. He explains what he means here in the last
sentence: objects must conform to our conceptual scheme because that
scheme makes possible the experience of such objects.

Though elements of Kant's 'Copernican' strategy remain unclear, the
basic idea is that Kant argues that what makes synthetic a priori
knowledge possible is the structure of our cognitive faculties,
including the pure forms of intuition and a privileged set of a priori
concepts. These forms and concepts jointly make experience possible and
allow us to draw inferences that hold with necessity and universality
concerning objects encountered in experience. What's more, Kant argues
that because a priori concepts are necessary for experience in general,
we can know that those concepts are applied legitimately, since he is
taking it as obvious that we have experience.
