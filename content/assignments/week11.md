We'll finish up our discussion of criticisms of doxastic agency (Boyle) and
reflection (Hieronymi) before turning to this week's topic, which concerns the
question of whether the capacity for rationality (in some sense) radically changes
one's other capacities (e.g. perception) or whether it is merely one additional
capacity. We'll look at two takes on the issue, one for (Boyle), and one against
(McLear). I also include some related papers as optional readings.
