This week we continue our discussion of Kantian compatibilist theories of
rationality. We'll look at Harry Frankfurt's influential non-causalist conception of
intentional action, along with his related conception of the "identification" of an
agent with its actions. We'll compare it to Henry Allison's influential idea that
Kant considers rational action to involve "incorporation" of a desire or impulse as
one's reason.
