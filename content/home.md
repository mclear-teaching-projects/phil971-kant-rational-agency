This is the homepage for **PHIL 971** â€“ Kantian Conceptions of Rational Agency

Kant famously considers moral agency to consist in acting from a grasp of rational
principles as such. But what is a rational principle and what is it to act from such
a principle? In this seminar we&rsquo;ll look at how Kant answers these questions, and
evaluate the theory of rational agency that results. We&rsquo;ll also look at the reception
of Kant&rsquo;s position in contemporary Anglophone philosophy, particularly in the work of
Frankfurt, Korsgaard, Velleman, Reath, and Herman. Some related questions we&rsquo;ll be
trying to find answers to include:

-   How does Kant conceive of the connection between rational action and free action?
-   What kind of metaphysical commitments does Kant build into his conception of
    rational action? Do any of these commitments seem plausible today?
-   What is the importance of the capacity for self-consciousness with respect to being rational?
