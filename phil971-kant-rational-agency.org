:END:

The course aims to elucidate Kant's conception of rational agency, in both its
theoretical and practical forms. Kant's view is then compared and contrasted with
contemporary, broadly kantian, approaches. We'll read various parts of Kant's
Critical works, alongside contemporary figures like Neta, Malmgren, Pereboom,
Korsgaard, Frankfurt, Velleman, Bratman, Boyle, Wolf, and Schafer. I'm also working on a
book manuscript on these issues, so we'll read parts from the manuscript as well.

Below is a rough plan of topics and readings (all subject to change). We'll end the
course with a guest appearance by Karl Schafer, to discuss his book manuscript on
Kant's conception of reason.

**** Eunhong
- Kant assumes that all casuality is sufficient causality – but why assume this? 
- 
**** John
#+begin_quote
why claim that the “conditioned” is not a subject matter of transcendental criticism
when the very validation of said concept is grounded on the phenomena, out from which
analyticity seems established. Isn’t this precisely the job of transcendental
criticism?
#+end_quote

- the concept <conditioned> analytically entails <condition>; so the very claim about
  the conditioned being given also gives its conditions is not something to which
  Kant objects. Hence no fear of transncendental criticism.

 The concept thus isn’t “established” by an appeal to phenomena (or appaearances)

#+begin_quote
it seems to me that Kant takes freedom and necessity as contradiction – i.e., the
demonstration of one must occasion the negation of the other (Alison 394). Why?
#+end_quote

- OK good - but first, why think that Kant endorses this opposition? And if he does
  what justification might there be for it?
- John makes a further point but I didn’t understand it
  

**** Chen
#+begin_quote
My question here is, does this mean [i.e. the separation of natural and free/intelligible
causality] that acting subjects have the same power of choice so they will make the
same decision under one circumstance? Or, if subjects will make different decisions
based on their previous experiences, how could Kant separate freedom from natural
causality completely? (Maybe Kant is not faced with such questions?)
#+end_quote

- Seems like this question might be answered by looking at the difference between
  intelligible and empirical character

**** Janelle
- NO Response

**** Trevor
#+begin_quote
I was always taught that Kant believes the world as it appears to us seems to have
causation but we don’t know whether things-in-themselves are in such law-like causal
relations. So why doesn’t Kant just admit that things-in-themselves may be free even
if all appearances and reasoning about appearances seem to suggest otherwise?
#+end_quote

- Question for Trevor: Is free action supposed to be non-deterministic? 

#+begin_quote
it strikes me as weird he is even talking about incompatibilism if we aren’t even aware of the true nature of things
#+end_quote

- Why talk about incompatibilism if we cannot know anything about things in
  themselves? 

#+begin_quote
if we are ignorant of our own nature, isn’t it possible that once we are “wound up”
so-to-speak we are then able to truly determine what happens? Put it another way, the
turnspit is wound up and then has the power of movement. Perhaps once we are “wound
up” we have a true two-way power, to cause either event A or event B.
#+end_quote

- OK - so what is it to “truly determine what happens”? 
- But fair question: why think we have anything more than ‘relative spontaneity’?

**** Precis questions
- in general paraphrase over quotation
- remember that these should be *shortentails the existence of a ground over which the agent can exert no causal inﬂuence*!

1. How can Kant say that practical and speculative freedom have nothing to do with
   one another?
   - As I said in class this is a controversial issue, and it points to the
     possibility that Kant had different competing conceptions of free action in his
     theory, some that were broadly compatibilist and some that were broadly
     incompatibilist. It is also possible that Kant simply changed his mind about
     certain core issues. 
2. What’s the difference between a practical presupposition and a presupposition more generally?
   - Kant is aiming to distinguish between presuppositions of acting in the world
     (i.e. what the world ought to be), vs. those that might be presuppositions of
     theoretical inquiry (i.e. inquiry as to what the world is). Kant’s view seems to
     be that the ‘speculative’ issue of whether we are absolutely
     spontaneous/transcendentally free is an issue that we can never give a
     satisfying answer, because we lack the right relationship to reality to be able
     to cognize the truth of our freedom. Nevertheless it may be the case that we
     “presuppose” our freedom in our actions in various ways. For example, if
     determinism is true, I’m not responsible for anything I do. However, if
     determinism is true I still have to deliberate as to what to do (it’s just that
     it turns out that my deliberations are temporally necessitated). However, in
     order to make sense of my activity of deliberation, I have to assume that my
     activity matters with respect to its result and that it isn’t a foregone
     conclusion what I’m to do (if it were a foregone conclusion then I would’t need
     to deliberate). So it seems that I need to presuppose my freedom to make sense
     “from the inside” of my activity of deliberation when I deliberate, even if in
     actuality I was never free at any point. In this sense the practical question of
     what I ought to believe or do is independent of the metaphysical (or speculative
     theoretical) question of what is really the case (or at least so Korsgaard has
     argued). We’ll look at this kind of reading of Kant in much more detail in
     week 6. 
   
**** Eunhong
- How are natural causation and freedom supposed to be compatible?
   + I talked around this in seminar but didn’t quite get all the way to discussing
     it. Kant’s view is that if time were fundamentally real then reality would be deterministically temporally structured and we could not be free/responsible. However, if his transcendental idealism is true, then space and time are not fundamentally real, but only ways in which what is real must appear to beings like us (i.e. as creatures with what he calls ‘forms of sensibility’). Since time is no longer an independent feature of reality, it is logically/epistemically possible that reality is structured in some other non-temporal causal way. This means that it is logically/epistemically possible that we could act as absolutely spontaneous causes. This is thus the sense in which Kant combines freedom and (pre-)determinism. There is determinism at the level of the objects of experience (whose ontological status depends in some sense “on us”) and, at least the possibility of, freedom at the level of things as they really are “in themselves”, i.e. things whose existence and nature don’t in any sense depend on our forms of sensibility (or our mind more generally).

**** Chen
- In what sense does Kant think there is a universal morality (case of elders in the mountains)?
   + Kant thinks that moral demands or requirements are all the “demands” that reason
     makes on finite rational beings. But that is just to say that if we were all
     rational then we would just act in the way that reason describes. In that sense,
     all moral requirements are requirements of rational beings, insofar as they are
     rational. Another way of putting this is that there cannot be a reason for me to
     \phi or \neg\phi that is not (in relevantly similar contexts) also a reason for you to \phi
     or \neg\phi. The universality of such reasons is not due to what you or I or society
     at large /decides/ or otherwise agrees to, but due to the nature of reason itself.
     So in Kant’s view there are going to be right and wrong answers about what
     morality requires, and these answers are right and wrong even if some people at
     some time or place act differently.

    Regarding the action-guiding nature of Kant’s conception of the categorical
    imperative, there’s a lot to say here both for and against. But I take one way
    of reading Kant’s discussion of the formula of the imperative as a universal law
    or law of nature and the ‘universalization’ procedure or thought experiment,
    universalization concerns a necessary constraint on moral ‘maxims’ (i.e.
    principles for action) that they not contradict themselves either in conception
    or practice. However, lack of contradiction is not /sufficient/ for a maxim’s
    status as moral. So even if it were true that there is no contradiction in the
    proposed example of society whose elderly go to die in the mountains, it could
    nevertheless still be true that maxims to act in such ways are morally
    wrong/defective for some further reason (e.g. for reasons stated by the third
    version of the moral law as valuing humanity, or the fourth version regarding
    membership in a “kingdom of ends”). 

**** John
1. How are we to understand the relationship between Freedom and Choice when one is not conceived as temporally grounded and the other is? I think I am having a little difficulty imagining how these two concepts of spontaneity are to be both causally relevant but not both temporally construable.
    + We didn’t really get into this issue in class, but Kant makes a distinction
      between the “will” (/Wille/) and the power of choice (/Willkür/). The power of
      choice brings about, or makes actual, some object or state of affairs through
      its exercise. The will is the principle by which the power of choice operates.
      Kant often however just speaks of “the will” without making this distinction. In
      any case, one’s choice is free just in the case that one chooses according to
      rational principles, and the capacity to choose (or the power of choice) is free
      just in case one can choose according to rational principles and is necessitated
      by sensible impulses. Since Kant strictly distinguishes between sensible
      impulses and rational causes, the only way one can choose freely is if one’s
      power of choice can be determined by a non-temporal causal ground, which in
      Kant’s view would be practical reason. 
2. Second, somewhere in the readings I got a sense that Choice seems to be exemplified
   as a power. If it were a power, could it be that it co-exists with other “powers”?
   I feel like this is not Kantian. But if Kant does in fact affirm the force of
   sensory impulses on Choice, then it sounds like there are competing powers at play
   in the human psyche…[and then what exactly is the question]?
    + As discussed in seminar this is exactly the right way to think about Kant’s
      view. He makes some clear statements to this effect at the beginning of the
      Dialectic in the /Critique of Pure Reason/. There he says

      #+begin_quote
      No force of nature can of itself depart from its own laws. Hence neither the
      understanding by itself (without the influence of another cause), nor the senses
      by themselves, can err; the first cannot, because while it acts merely according
      to its own laws, its effect (the judgment) must necessarily agree with these laws
      (Transcendental illusion, A294/B350; see also JL 9:53-4, /Wiener/ /Logik/ 24:824-5, /Refl./ 
      R2142 16:250 (1776-1781))
      #+end_quote

      Kant construes error as the result of the deviation of a capacity’s activity from its characteristic laws in a kind of “geometry of error”, and which, since the issue is always one of causality, must be construed in terms of the causal interaction of different capacities upon one another.32  As he puts it in the Vienna Logic:

      #+begin_quote
      Error is neither in the understanding alone, then, nor in the senses alone; instead,
      it always lies in the influence of the senses on the understanding, when we do not
      distinguish well the inﬂuence of sensibility on the understanding. (24:825)
      #+end_quote
     
      Hence errors in thinking—i.e. the use of the capacities of understanding and judgment—arise as a product of the influence of sensibility on the intellect. More generally, the laws constitutive of the intellect produce particular effects unless interfered with by some external or ‘alien’ causal power.

**** Janelle
I think we answered Janelle’s question in seminar. To reiterate, Kant’s view seems to
be that rational beings are responsible, even if they act in habitually vicious ways,
since they nevertheless have a capacity to do the right/rational thing. Whether this
position is fully defensible is another story. 
*** General Comments
**** Why ‘Transcendental’ Freedom?
- 'transcendental' usually means ‘condition of the possibility of’; so here we can
  think of it as designating the conditions of imputation 
**** What is the relation between T and P freedom?
- It isn’t really clear why T freedom is presupposed by P freedom. Seems like they
  are really just independent of each other. Perhaps Kant’s idea is that what we are
  interested in are beings capable of rationally structuring/shaping their lives in a way
  such that the choices they make in such structuring are imputable to them. So the
  whole discussion runs through the notion of imputation/authorship of action

#+begin_quote
In the example of the Ishihara test for color blindness, it says that “one
distinguishes between two objects not merely because one is sensitive to differences
in color but because one recognizes that one is blue and the other red”(p.6). So I
assume a case for a dog that the dog can distinguish two objects by their different
odors. It seems that the basis for distinguishing the subject the dog takes the odor
of the first object as a reason for it’s being different from the second object. So
it’s not clear for me what’s the essential difference here.
#+end_quote

In discussion today we distinguished between four levels of sophistication:

1. Mere differential discrimination (e.g. sorting red things from blue things)
2. Differential discrimination + Recognition of some sort of difference (e.g. sorting
   reds from blues because they are different, but not sure how they are different)
3. Differential discrimination + Recognition of the *basis* of the difference (e.g.
   sorting reds from blues, and representing the reds and blues as such) 
4. Differential discrimination *because of* Recognition of the basis of the
   difference (e.g. sorting the reds from blues because the reds are /red/ and the
   blues are /blue/)

Kant seems to allow that mere animals can do (1) and (2) but not (3) and (4). In his
terms, they have acquaintance but not cognition of objects and their differences (or
similarities). Rational beings such as humans can do (1)-(4) 

#+begin_quote
I know that there might be some higher things like reflection and apprehension
(p.11), but what’s the specific manifestation of them in distinguishing objects by
colors or odors? Kitcher denies that “cognizers must have the concept ‘mark’ or the
concept ‘concept’ or the very abstract ‘representation’” (p.14), but McLear claims
that “non-rational animals lack the freedom necessary to attend to the nature of the
acts that in a rational being have particular features that are present in any
(conceptual) representations that they might generate (i.e. the categories)” (p.18).
#+end_quote

I’m advocating a reading of Kant such that he doesn’t think that, in order to do (3)
and (4) one needs intellectually demanding concepts such as <basing> or <operative
reason>, or <mark>. But one does need to be able to engage in a particular kind of
mental act, namely attending to one’s own mental activity and the way one of one’s
conditions is connected to another. Kant seems to think (for reasons we can discuss
next time if you like) that only a rational being can control their attention in this
way. 

#+begin_quote
I tend to agree that a dog doesn’t have the concept “concept”, but doubt whether a
dog have the concept “odor” or other concepts, even if such "concepts" might not be
so mature and clear. (However, I feel my question needs more experiments of animals
instead of philosophical arguments). Besides, I need more explanations and examples
for Kant’s thinking that “any mental state whose ‘content’ can be something ‘for
me’(rather than merely ‘in me’), must be something that I can characterize as
(partly) constituting the character of that very point of view that I have”(p.16).
Does this require that if a dog is a rational being, it should be aware of its
actions, its control on its actions and the reason for its actions?
#+end_quote

In the second edition of the /Critique of Pure Reason/ Kant says that the “I think
must be able to accompany all my representations; for otherwise something would be
represented in me that absolutely could not be thought” (B131-2). There are many
things one might say about this claim. But at the very least, it seems to express a
basic commitment of Kant’s conception of a /thinker/ qua /rational being/. A rational
being must be able to be aware (note, not that it is /always aware/) of what it
thinks. I take this to mean more generally that anything that can be a /reason for
which/ a rational agent has some condition, has to be something that is a constituent
of that agent’s point of view, and thereby accessible in some way /to/ the agent.

**** Eunhong
#+begin_quote
I would like to ask what the object-involving representation of the exercise of disposition is, and how we get the object-involving representation. This question could be unfair to Ram Neta, but I would like to know how the object-involving representation of the exercise of disposition is possible. Is it possible because of the adroitness of our internal structure to focus on that specific object? Or, is it possible because we have such a disposition that is related to that object?  
#+end_quote

I don’t want to speak for Ram, so one thing to do is follow-up with him. But maybe a
couple of points are relevant. Ram defines an “object-involving” representation as a
“representation that contains, and so is partly constituted by, the object that it
represents” (Neta 2019, 201). He gets this notion, at least in part, from John
McDowell and Gareth Evans’ idea of “de re sense”. There is a question as to whether
there even could be such a kind of representation (i.e. whether object-involving
representations in general are even possible). I take Ram to just be assuming for the
sake of argument that they are possible (i.e. he’s not giving us any further argument
for their existence). Now, one kind of object-involving representation there could be
is a representation of /oneself/ – this is a /de se/ representation, in Ram’s terms. 

Now, if we grant that de se object-involving representations are possible (and Ram
just assumes that they are), Ram then asks us to consider a special type of de se
object-involving representation, namely one that takes as its object (i.e. as a
constituent of the representation) the exercise (or actualization) of a disposition
of oneself. 

Ram then gets even more specific. The object-involving de se representation isn’t
just a representation of oneself, nor of the exercise of a disposition. Rather it is
the representation of the exercise of one’s disposition to represent /that very
exercise/. 

Assuming that we grant the possibility of object-involving representations, the
question is whether there is a place to reject Ram’s claim. Is it at the idea of a
/de se/ object-involving representation? Or the idea of a de se representation of the
exercise of a disposition? Or the idea of the /reflexive/ nature of the
representation as representing the exercise of the disposition to represent that very
exercise?  

#+begin_quote
Ram says if the agent has the capacity for first-person reflective access to her
current representations, it will also be possible for her to enjoy such reflective
access to the instances of the basing relation that obtain currently in her case.
However, what’s the meaning of having first-person reflective access?
#+end_quote

It’s not totally clear to me what his answer to this is. He says that reflective
access is access in “the same way as the other contents of her various thoughts and
feelings are accessible to her” (Neta 2019, 202). So this seems to mean that one’s
access to the basing relations between one’s conditions is similar to one’s access
to, e.g., the content of what one is currently judging or thinking, the fact that one
is hungry or sleepy, etc.

**** Trevor
#+begin_quote
In Ram Neta’s work “The Basing Relation”, I don’t think I understand his challenge to
Representationalism that he gives on pages 196-198. The idea is that Toshiro
represents CNN as trustworthy on cases like the news story about Russia and Syria and
so believes the report and that the report provides him justification (196). However,
what caused his belief is this subliminal message which also causes an aphasia in him
such that he cannot connect “his belief about the trustworthiness of CNN with his
belief about the content of its broadcast to deduce any consequences from their
conjunction” (197). For this reason, the representation supposedly cannot explain the
belief. But why not? 

First problem, the aphasia is “temporary but severe” so doesn’t the maintaining of
the belief still fit the representationalist model (i.e. won’t the representation,
even if it couldn’t explain it for a certain amount of time, eventually explain the
belief, and thus we can write this off as a strange circumstance?). 
#+end_quote

Perhaps the idea is that we want to explain /this/ particular instance and not
whether Toshiro’s post-aphsic condition will be well-based?

#+begin_quote
Second, somehow Toshiro cannot connect his justifying belief with his belief about
the contents of the report, but then why does Neta say that “he also represents...CNN
as a trustworthy news source in cases such as this, and so he believes that the CNN
report provides him with justification...” (my emphasis) (196). It seems like if his
belief about their reliability is the reasons he represents the content as such, then
doesn’t it explain the belief?
#+end_quote

I’m not certain, but does this elide the difference between a reason why and a reason
for which? Ram also says that the subliminal message “prevents [Toshiro] from putting
together his belief about the trustworthiness of CNN with his belief about the
content of its broadcast to deduce any consequences from their conjunction” (Neta
2019, 197). So Toshiro has a mistaken view of the reason why he holds the belief.

The clarification question is the following: Why would this [viz. wit as a talent for
applying rules to particulars] not be a solution to the [overintellectualization] worry?
#+end_quote

- I’m not entirely sure I’ve gotten the right read of your question. But my point
  about Kant’s conception of ‘mother wit’ in applying rules is that it would seem to
  go against a strong reading of the representationalist account of taking, where all
  acts of taking are construed as involving an explicit representation of a rule. 

- The worry about circularity is different. Suppose the representationalist says that
  we need to explain what an inference is (as opposed to mere association or a mental
  hiccup, etc.) by means of appeal to “taking”. But what /is/ taking? The
  representationalist owes us an answer. It would thus be bad if, in giving their
  answer, the representationalist says “OK - in taking A as based on B, you represent
  a rule (e.g. Ax->Bx), the satisfaction of the antecedent of that rule (e.g. Ax),
  and then /infer/ that Bx.” Here it seems you’d be defining inference by appeal to
  taking and then taking by appeal to inference. And it seems even worse if you have
  to appeal to taking itself in giving the definition (i.e. in taking A as based on B,
  you represent a rule (e.g. Ax->Bx), the satisfaction of the antecedent of that rule
  (e.g. Ax), and then /taking/ that Bx). The representationalist thus seems stuck
  with a real worry about vicious circularity.

1. In your paper, you discuss the three points which show human person’s conceptual
   representation is different from that of non-rational beings. The first mark is
   seen in page 8. The third is right in the middle of page 9. Number 2 is not that
   explicit. My suspicion is that it is in the paragraph which figures in both pages
   8 and 9. But for the sake of clarity, may I seek for an explicit formulation of
   the second mark as conceived?

    + I think I formulate it this way: “a second feature of conceptual
      representation—viz. its ultimate unification in a “highest concept” (conceptus summus).” (p. 9)

2. In footnote 22, you seem to imply that we cannot say that all thinking is of an inherently objective type; for it “forecloses the possibility of there being an objective form of non-rational representation”. Can you give an example of this of a non-rational representation which is essentially bereft of any object? (Another mention of this is on page 13 (on the number four), but this has an object – which is number 4, however conceptually construed).

    - Consider experiences such as "brain gray" and the pink glow that you have when
      your eyes are closed. These seem to be cases in which there is something
      represented (though perhaps not /thought/) but it isn’t represented as an
      object—i.e. as a thing with a property. Instead there is just /grayness/ or
      /pinkness/ (however one’s description of this experience goes.

3. Something struck me as “seemingly the usual case” for explaining why S did what she did, or, in the case of making inference, why S made the “rational transition” that she did (I am in page 16 now) – it seems the analysis is always retrospective. In other words, what we think of as “conceptually demanding” an attentive control seems to be a judgement that we make towards S who has, already in the past, did the inferential transition (page 16). I understand that even Anscombe’s “Why” test has to be employed when an act has already been done or executed, ergo, settled in the past (We read G.E. Anscombe’s Intention lately, apologies for the import). I guess this is not a question but an implicit resignation on the metaphysical limit of our inquiry. Evaluation will always be retrospective. We will always be limited by how much, or how reliable our access is to S’s epistemic goings-on. 

    - We discussed this in class, but I take it that we should ask why evaluation will
      always be retrospective? Don’t we often do things with an aim in mind, and so full
      knowledge of what we are doing?

4. In page 17, you claim that dispositions are not the ground but are consequences of mental activity. Here is my difficulty: Suppose we have S who is the subject matter of our inquiry. We asked her: “Hey, why did you think that we would not have a quiz on Friday when the syllabus says we have?” S will of course give us her inferential reasons for saying so – she will cite the accessible pieces of information which, individually and collectively, were causally relevant to the coming to be of her judgement that there will be no quiz on Friday. Let us say that she was wrong in inferring that there would be no quiz that Friday. But then, upon analysis, we realize that her interpretation of the said pieces of information, say information a, b, c, d, were, to some degree, informed by the disposition to believe that there will be no quiz. After all, our judgements can sometimes be influenced by the dispositions that we have on particular subject matters; so perhaps, S simply looked into the pieces of information under the lenses of her disposition to believe (or deny?) that there is a quiz that Friday. Might this be an instance in which disposition towards a, b, d, and d act as the ground for rational activity rather than a consequence.

    - My main point is that the disposition isn’t simply a brute fact about the agent,
      but is, or is connected to, her capacity for rationality as such

5. In page 18, you claim that for Kant, one has to be “aware of the contentful states as one’s own” because it is “necessary for engaging in reasoning”. Is this awareness the “occurrent” type in our modern philosophical parlance? I was just wondering if it would render me somewhat irrational, if I were measured against Kant’s notion of awareness, in the many times when I had to turn left to South Street without an explicit “taking” of my mental state, or almost absent-mindedly,  each  time I had to drive towards home (because it has become so automatic there are times when I just get to realize that I am already home).   

    - No – here there is a "making sense" that doesn’t require explicit reflection. These
      aspects of one’s experience show up in one’s point of view, but one doesn’t need to
      explcitly go through a sort of meta-cognitive act of reflection on them to
      rationally respond to them. Kant says only that the “I think” must /be able/ to
      accompany my thoughts, not that it /always must/ accompany them.

Kant takes it for granted that not lying is a universal law under any circumstance. However, many others might will that lying is allowed only if it protects others’ lives. Does Kant set other conditions to check whether a maxim can become a universal law? For me, it seems that Kant directly jump from his maxim to the universal law based on his own “moral intuition"
#+end_quote

Kant's view of lying is certainly controversial but I think we can see why he held
it. Recall that in our discussion today I portrayed practical reasoning as an
activity of "reasoning" from the conditions of something's being actual, to its
actuality. Practical reasoning is thus a sort of "productive thinking". I suggested
that we understand Kant as being somewhat equivocal as to whether productive thinking
is always successful in bringing about the desired object/state of affairs, since
there may be circumstances beyond a subject's control that undermine their attempt to
bring about what is desired. But Kant also thinks there are two ways practical
reasoning can go awry, besides that its outcome is frustrated by conditions beyond
the agent's control, and these two ways give us some insight into why he thinks lying
is wrong.

The first way of going astray in reasoning (practical or not) is by trying to judge
something involving two opposing concepts (e.g. P and \neg P). This is what Kant calls a
"contradiction in conception" (4:423). Kant claims that his first two case studies
(of suicide and false promising) in the /Groundwork/ are cases of contradiction in the
/conception/ of the maxim (or subjective principle) of action. The second way of going
astray is trying to will something in an in an incoherent way. This is a
"contradiction in willing" (i.e. a form of incoherence in the productive activity of
thinking that is characteristic of practical reasoning) and is supposed to be
instanced by the third and fourth case studies (i.e. of "rusting talents" and
beneficence). There has been a /great deal/ of discussion as to how we should
understand the notion of "contradiction" as it plays out in these two cases. Kant
seems to think that duty to truth is a duty whose violation would involve a
contradiction in /conception/ (e.g. 6:431). In the /Metaphysics of Morals/ he gives this
characterization of the contradiction:

#+begin_quote
But communication of one's thoughts to someone through words that yet (intentionally)
contain the contrary of what the speaker thinks on the subject is an end that is
directly opposed to the natural purposiveness of the speaker's capacity to
communicate his thoughts, and is thus a renunciation by the speaker of his
personality, and such a speaker is a mere deceptive appearance of a man, not a man
himself. (6:429)
#+end_quote

The relevant contradiction seems to be in the concept of the purpose of
communication. In asserting something (as one does in lying) there is a communicative
intention to say what is the case. But in lying one is making an assertion with the
intentionally opposed aim (i.e. one intends to communicate what is not the case).
Thus Kant considers any maxim concerned with the goodness of lying fails to be
universal or necessary because it fails to make a conceptually coherent claim. Of
course, whether Kant is right about this is an entirely different issue. It does,
however, serve to insulate him from the charge that he is appealing to just another
moral intuition. He may be wrong in his position about lying, or his argument for
that position may not be convincing. But he is not simply appealing to our rational
insight concerning the badness of lying. 

You also ask:

#+begin_quote
For those who agree that lying is allowed only if it protects others’ lives, this is not out of their personal interests. Should we deem them as irrational beings according to their different “moral intuition”? Or shall we say that they have a tendency of sympathy which influences their moral judgment?
#+end_quote

It may well be true that people who lie may be doing so on the basis of
considerations that are entirely "other-regarding", in the sense that they are based
entirely on what will bring good consequences for others. However, such good
consequences would not change what is considered a contradiction in one's conception
of what to do.  
**** Trevor

The Kant quote you start from is:

#+begin_quote
All material practical principles as such are, without exception, of one and the same kind and come under the general principle of self-love or one’s own happiness” (Theorem 2 at 5:22)
#+end_quote

I think the following is a way of paraphrasing your question (let me know if not):

- Does Kant's prohibition against material principles in moral action indicate his
  holding a source incompatibilist position?

I think that the short answer is "yes", though not for the reason you suggest, which
is that a rational person would not act against the principle of her own happiness. I
think Kant's position is rather that a rational person would not act against the
principle of her own happiness, unless that principle contravenes the moral law. In
such a case she /should/ act against what will make her happy, though perhaps she won't
since she isn't fully rational. But I take it that the point of your example is to
emphasize that in evaluating the moral status of the act of the mother with regard to
her child, the issue isn't whether she could do otherwise, but the nature of her
motive to act (i.e. the nature of the principle of her practical activity). And that
of course is a source (in)compatibilist rather than leeway(in)compatibilist position.

#+begin_quote
In approaching the question of happiness, I can sense that Kant seems to want to insulate it from the contingent influences of feelings and impulses; for in doing so he would be able to posit a conception of happiness that is pursued on the grounds of objective law respected, as it were, by the will (Willie – the principle of freewill). The former is marred by empirical influences; the latter thus seems safeguarded. If this reading is correct, the resulting framework becomes obvious – happiness (and the correlative notion of self-love?), because it is extirpated from subjective impulses, follows an objective principle and thus must be pursued without regard for self-serving motives.

... might not the empirical-theoretical distinction Kant wants to establish for happiness end up becoming hair-splitting exercise? I understand Kant’s motive. I agree with his distinction of the empirical and the theoretical, especially in light of the desire to protect happiness from creeping selfish desires. But there are types of happiness for which aversion from suffering, which is both and at the same time sensible and conceptual, seems an integral part. I am wondering if Kant ever considered that there are empirically based conditions – like human suffering – which are at the same time conceptually construable as necessitating some objective maxims.
#+end_quote

I think this rests on a (itself entirely understandable) misunderstanding of Kant's
view. He sees happiness and the moral as at best /contingently/ aligned (or opposed).
To pursue happiness is to structure one's practical reasoning on the basis of
principles (i.e. represented laws) concerning the agreeableness of some expected
pleasure. Kant is unconcerned with whether this agreeableness is sensory or
conceptual, and so in that sense is not concerned with the higher/lower distinction
(see CPrR 5:23-4).

Kant considers moral motivation to consist in the activity of practically reasoning
to some conclusion (i.e. the actualization of some object or state of affairs)
without regard to the agreeableness of that activity or the pleasure in its result.
This is not to deny that rational or moral actions can be pleasurable (quite the
contrary), but they cannot be done for the sake of the pleasure they produce. So
learning about the suffering of others (or of oneself) may be the basis for acting
morally, but only if one then acts on rational grounds rather than grounds of pleasure
(e.g. because one takes pleasure in seeing suffering alleviated). 
**** Eunhong
I think we addressed Eunhong's questions in class (though let me know if otherwise!),
but to summarize, Kant considers reason to be a distinct faculty from understanding,
at least in part because the concepts reason generates ("ideas") are generated via a
different form of activity---viz. inference rather than reflection. And we talked
about what "prior to experience" might mean with respect to the a priori. It doesn't
mean (or needn't anyway), "independent of any experiential content", as we can of
course reason about the implications of some empirical judgment. Nor does it mean
"temporally prior to experience" since we cannot reason about anything before we have
started to have sensory experiences. It rather means reasoning "from ground to
consequence", so that a priori knowledge is knowledge of thing from its ground or
sufficient condition. We have a priori knowledge concerning the empirical world
because our faculties are the sufficient ground of that knowledge.
**** Janelle
I take it you had two questions:

1. Can one make the case that it is possible for the sociopath to be a moral exemplar? 
2. To what extent does Kant think we should consider consequences in determining
   whether to (rationally) act one way rather than another? 
   

Concerning (1) the issue is whether the sociopath can act out of respect for the
moral law. Since one can mean a lot of different things by "sociopath" it seems to be
just unclear what the answer is. If the sociopath can act in a way such that their
practical reasoning is shaped by the representation (in a principle) of reason's
law as such and not because of some pleasure then yes, and if not, then no.

Concerning (2) It's fine if (expected) consequences play a role in one's practical
reasoning (indeed, this is essential to prudential reasoning as to what to do to
achieve one's ends). That firing the gun will result in the death of the child is a
factor in determining whether it is morally ok to fire the gun. What is not a morally
relevant factor, and what undermines the moral status of the action, is if one's
practical reasoning is based on/in the agreeable or pleasurable nature of the action or
its consequences. Here's Kant being pretty explicit about this:

#+begin_quote
If the determination of his will rests on the feeling of agreeableness or
disagreeableness that he expects from some cause, it is all the same to him by what
kind of representation he is affected. The only thing that concerns him, in order to
decide upon a choice, is how intense, how long, how easily acquired, and how often
repeated this agreeableness is. (5:23)

The principle of one’s own happiness, however much understanding and reason may be
used in it, still contains no determining ground for the will other than such as is
suitable to the lower faculty of desire; and thus either there is no higher faculty
of desire at all or else pure reason must be practical of itself and alone, that is,
it must be able to determine the will by the mere form of a practical rule without
presupposing any feeling and hence without any representation of the agreeable or
disagreeable as the matter of the faculty of desire, which is always an empirical
condition of principles. Then only, insofar as reason of itself (not in the
service of the inclinations) determines the will, is reason a true higher faculty of
desire, to which the pathologically determinable is subordinate, and then only is
reason really, and indeed specifically, distinct from the latter, so that even the
least admixture of the latter’s impulses infringes upon its strength and superiority,
just as anything at all empirical as a condition in a mathematical demonstration
degrades and destroys its dignity and force. In a practical law reason determines the
will immediately, not by means of an intervening feeling of pleasure or displeasure,
not even in this law; and that it can as pure reason be practical is what alone makes
it possible for it to be lawgiving. (5:24-5)

#+begin_quote
Kant also knew that human beings are determined by the laws of nature, and he seems
to think that we need a different sort of causality. If we only have causality of
laws of nature, we will always have to be subordinated by the natural law. Human has
no choice but to live in this world following the natural law. Then, how can our
behaviors be free actions?
#+end_quote

Kant think that the argument about the idea of freedom from the first /Critique/ that
we read a few weeks ago opens up the possibility that fundamental reality (including
ourselves) is atemporal. Thus it is at least logically and epistemically possible
that there is a form of causality that does not involve time, and that allows agents
to be causes without being caused by anything else in time. Kant thus thinks that the
possibility of free action depends on the truth of Transcendental Idealism, which is
the doctrine that spatial and temporal properties are merely relational properties of
things, and are entirely grounded in the nature of our sensibility---i.e. our mode of
perceiving objects. 


#+begin_quote
I was wondering how many people can be free agents. If our maxims are not universally followed, then lots of our behavior will be non-free behaviors.
#+end_quote

One longstanding question is whether Kant can explain the possibility of evil action
(or even just irrational action) that is nevertheless imputable to the agent. At
least several of Kant's contemporaries or immediate successors (e.g. Reinhold,
Schmid, Schelling) thought that he failed to show how this was possible. We'll
discuss this more in class today.

#+begin_quote
Also, What I still could not understand is what Kant says as "analogous". Kant says
“a kingdom of ends is thus possible only by analogy with a kingdom of nature.” What
the analogy and why the kingdom of ends is possible only by analogy with a kingdom of
nature? Is it because we are human following the natural law? Or, is it because we
just cannot see the harmony between the kingdom of ends and the kingdom of nature?
#+end_quote

Kant thinks an analogy always has a fourfold structure; e.g. A is to B as C is to D. In
this case the relata are agents and laws. There is supposed to be an analogy between
an agent and laws of nature and an agent and laws of rationality/morality. In both
cases the laws constitute a realm or world (/Reich/). The salient difference of course
is that the laws of nature externally necessitate while the laws of the kingdom of
ends are internally given by the nature of our own rational faculty.

#+begin_quote
Kant first introduces that a rational being should belong to the world of understanding instead of the world of sense. Then Kant provides two explanations separately targeting at two worlds. But in the second explanation, Kant uses the term “the intelligible world”, so it seems I should assume that “the world of understanding” equals “the intelligible world”. Then does “intelligence” also equal “understanding”, or should I explain the capacity of understanding by intelligence? 
#+end_quote

The German for "understanding" is "/Verstand/", which could also be translated as
"intellect". Kant also typically translates the Latin term "/Intellectus/" via the
German "/Verstand/". Hence his tendency to talk about the "understanding", "the world
of understanding" and the "intelligible world" together. An "intelligence" is a
living being with intellectual faculties (or rational faculties more broadly). So
human beings are "intelligences" in this sense, while non-human (non-rational)
animals are not. Kant distinguishes (at least nominally) between intelligence and
what he calls "personality" (or between intelligences and persons). To be a person is
not just to have intelligence, it is also to be able to act on the basis of the moral
law as the sufficient motive of one's choices. For human beings, personality is also
connected with the sensible preconditions of moral action---viz. moral feeling,
conscience, love of humanity, and self-respect (MM 6:399-403).

#+begin_quote
I’m not sure but my own interpretation here is that sense can receive stimuli of
materials from the world of sense but only understanding can “unite sensible
representations in one consciousness” “with the use of sensibility” (4: 452), and
understanding thus change materials in the world of sense into materials in the world
of understanding with the use of intelligence, under the rules of reason. Does reason
set the rules for the world of understanding or guide the capacity of understanding
to handle those materials? Is there a higher world, like the world of things in
themselves, in which only reason can deal with the materials there?
#+end_quote

Broadly speaking yes. Kant's appeal to an intelligible world, like his discussion of
intelligible character in the first /Critique/, concerns a world as it is /thought/
rather than /sensed/, and thus one that is not presented to us as being essentially
spatio-temporal in structure (and thus in the kinds of laws it is subject to). Kant
considers the role of understanding to be that of structuring the sensible material
given to it, so that it can be thought (i.e. "judged" -- Kant equates thinking and
judging). Reason then aims to systematize these judgments. Theoretical reason does
this by seeking the sufficient conditions of a judgment, thereby explaining it, and
practical reason does this by starting from a universal judgment that is the
condition (in the sense of being productive) of some object or state of affairs.  

#+begin_quote
is this to say that things in themselves divides the world of sense and the world of
understanding? If the world of understanding always remains the same, do things in
themselves belong to this world? Then is there a third world higher than the world of
understanding? Besides, what’s the function of reason here?
#+end_quote

Kant's discussion is tricky because there are two different, but for Kant closely
related, kinds of distinctions being made here. The sensible vs. intelligible world
contrast is a distinction made with reference to specific kinds of faculties or
capacities. This would seem to be a primarily /epistemic/ distinction. The thing as it
appears vs as it is in itself is less obviously a purely epistemic distinction, and
more a /metaphysical/ distinction, especially since Kant thinks that the way that
things are in themselves at least partially grounds or explains the way that they
appear to us. Hence things in themselves are more metaphysically fundamental than
things as they appear. The difficulty is that Kant /also/ thinks that things as they
appear are in fact partly metaphysically constituted by /us/ (i.e. by our faculties).
So the sensible world, understood as the domain of objects that relate to the senses
or "phenomena", is at least partly metaphysically constituted by our sensible
faculties. The intelligible world, understood as the domain of objects in relation to
the intellect, or "noumena", is not metaphysically dependent on our intellect (though
it may be on God's). In any case there is no further "third world", and reason's
function is explanation (in systematizing the judgments provided by the
understanding) and rational production (in practical agency).

#+begin_quote
[Korsgaard] has us imagine a case where someone is participating in a scientific
experiment that has them live a day of their life with a device implanted in their
brain. You know that every day the device is in your brain, your day is
preprogrammed. However, the device is supposed to both, (i) not bypass your thought
processes but “work through them” and (ii) determine what you think. She then
describes the first person experience of how the participants' thoughts must go on
such a day in order to illustrate that we must act as if we are free. I find
something fishy about (i) and (ii). If (ii) is true, then this is as good as ghostly
possession as far as I am concerned. In such a world, I think there is no argument
that the device is literally responsible for your actions.
#+end_quote

I am a bit confused by your last point. It seems that the device in this scenario /is/
responsible for your actions. It is their ultimate causal explanation. Insofar as
Korsgaard does not endorse this conclusion she must be rejecting the idea that
responsibility for action depends on being the ultimate causal source of one's
actions.

#+begin_quote
However, we are supposed to imagine that the description of the case is consistent with it working through your thoughts. To my ear, that sounds strictly speaking impossible, instead, I think the device would have to make it appear to you as if it is working through your thoughts. But now, I have no handle on what such an internal mental life of that person would look like.
#+end_quote

Korsgaard's point seems to be that the internal mental life of such a person would
look exactly like yours or mine (at least insofar as deliberation goes). Why do you
think the actions of the device would only /appear/ to work via one's thoughts? Is the
idea that in deliberation one thought is supposed to cause the next, but the activity
of the device would suggest that /it/ causes each thought and thus that /it/ rather than
deliberative activity is what is really going on? If that were right then Korsgaard's
example would not be describing deliberation so much as its mere /simulation/ and that
does indeed seem objectionable. 
**** John
Reconstructing Korsgaard's "argument from humanity" is going to be controversial in
one way or another. Her aim, however, is clearly stated. Korsgaard argues that
"humanity", or rational nature, is the capacity to set ends freely through the
exercise of practical reason rather than following ends given by instinct. So it
isn't that (as your premise 2 has it) all ends derive from the unconditional value of
humanity. Rather, all morally/rationally required ends (duties) derive from the
unconditional value of humanity. This means that, if we are to act rationally, we
must harmonize our rational ends with those of others, and attach equal weight to the
value of their ends as we do to our own. For helpful discussion (and criticism) of
her argument see Bukoski, Michael. “Korsgaard’s Arguments for the Value of Humanity.”
The Philosophical /Review/ 127, no. 2 (2018): 197–224.

#+begin_quote
Why is it that freedom is ipso facto an adherence to moral law?
#+end_quote

Kant's answer to this question is relatively straightforward, though hinges on
assumptions that are not clearly defended (and may not be defensible). Kant thinks
that all acts require appeal to the causality of a being (i.e. a substance), and that
such causality is lawful, which means that it is universal and necessary (see
especially GIII, 4:446-7). Since we're asking about morality, we're interested in
/imputable/ acts of choice related to what we desire, so Kant thinks that natural
causation is ruled out (since time undermines the control necessary for
imputability). Kant's conception of the rational form of causation that is
constitutive of moral action is one according to which nothing over and above the
formal structure of causality itself is determinative of the effect of the action
(through the desire for it). So moral acts are all brought about by a productive
desire whose aim is to produce its act merely in virtue of the universality and
necessity of the action, and not it's aim (the "matter" of the judgment or maxim).

Korsgaard, in contrast, relates freedom not to a special kind of causality, but to
the reflective endorsement of a motive (to believe or act). Korsgaard, like Kant,
thinks that such activity is rule governed (norm governed), and connects these rules
to the various "practical identities" that an agent can adopt. However there is one
practical identity that Korsgaard considers constitutive of agency as such, and that
is the identity of rational agency itself (or "humanity" as she calls it). So the
conditions of action require appeal to norms that are /constitutive/ of action as such.

my question is, is friendship just a relation between all of those participating in the practice, or is friendship going to be something actually personal? 
#+end_quote

It would help in understanding your question to hear more about what "actually
personal" is supposed to come to here. To the extent that I understand Korsgaard
here, I believe her view is that the relationship of "friendship" that one has to
others requires that one take their ends as meaningful and valuable, in the same
manner that one takes one's own. This means, among other things, that opportunities
to promote those ends tend to be salient and motivationally efficacious. Similarly,
in the "Kingdom of Ends" we would all act towards one another in the manner we do to
our friends. Hence friendship (or this aspect of it) is a way of characterizing the
relation of oneself to others in the KoE.

#+begin_quote
2. How compatible are Kant and Aristotle regarding friendship? Kant claims in the GMM
   that the good will is the only thing that’s good in and of itself wherein A claims
   that friends are not only goods, but virtue friends are good for the sake of
   which.
#+end_quote

I'm not certain that Kant has a well worked out view of friendship, so it is hard for
me to say how deep similarities or differences between his view and Aristotle's will
be. However, on at least on way of conceiving of a friend for the sake of which one
acts, Kant's account of respect for the value of humanity in others and equal
treatment of their ends might be in accord with it. 

#+begin_quote
3. How does the beginning or formulation of friendships go for a Kantian? Would the
   motives be right prior into entering the relation? Or, if (1) is just that we get
   the friendship in virtue of being citizens of the KOE, we may not even need that
   story?
#+end_quote

Even for Kant, not every relation one has to another needs to be understood morally,
including friendship. That said, morality restricts ways in which we can permissibly
act with respect to others, including our friends (or engaging in friendship). For
example, morality prohibits striking up a "friendship" (or perhaps better, a mutual
acquaintance) solely for the purpose of bringing about one's personal ends. This is a
feature of Kant's broader conception of the moral law as prohibiting the merely
instrumental use of others in one's actions.

how free of “external” influences do spontaneous judgments need to be?
#+end_quote

The tldr version of the below is that what is spontaneous about judgment is not that
it occurs prior to or independent of any experiential basis, but that in judgment one
connects concepts in a way that spontaneous rather than receptive. 

---

Allison and I take somewhat different views as to exactly what Kant is saying when he
says that judgment is a "spontaneous" activity. Allison seems to think that Kant is
saying merely that we need to /conceive/ of judgment as a spontaneous activity, while I
think Kant is saying that a necessary condition of judgment's being /judgment/ is that
it /is/ a spontaneous activity. But be that as it may, I think we can understand Kant
as saying that judgment is a kind of (rational) mental act that relates or connects
two (or more) concepts, e.g., "the cat is black". This relating or connecting is
different from /associating/ two contents (<cat> and <black>). And it is different from
/perceiving/ two contents (/catness/ and /blackness/).

Kant seems to think that perception doesn't present things in terms of truth or
falsity. And he thinks that association only says something about how things are with
the associating subject rather than how things are with respect to the world. So one
special feature of judgment is that the connection between concepts results in a
claim that could be true or false. In the terms I've been arguing for in this
seminar, Kant thinks that judgment involves a kind of /rational/ (i.e. non-temporal)
basing of one represented content on another. In a simple case of an analytic
judgment, Kant thinks that the assertion (or "positing" as he often says) of
<bachelor> is a sufficient condition for asserting <unmarried>) of that bachelor. So
in the terms we were using a few weeks ago in talking about "taking" (and "basing"
more generally) Kant thinks that the assertion that the subject is unmarried is /based/
on the fact that the subject is a bachelor, and that this basis of predicate on
subject cannot be understood in terms of association or perception. 

Given Kant's view that temporal causation is irrational and part of receptivity and
non-temporal causation is rational and part of spontaneity, his view seems to be that
the basing relation needed to explain judgment (and really any kind of discursive
activity, from conceptualization on up to rational inference) is one that must be
spontaneous rather than receptive.

1.	In reference to “the rational form of causation that is constitutive of moral action is one according to which nothing over and above the formal structure of causality itself is determinative of the effect of the action (through the desire for it)”

-	By “rational form” what do you mean by it? Do we call causation “rational form” when we explain actions stemming from the agent? Is this sui generis or just the concept of causation understood within the framework of agency (as opposed to the general concept of causation qua being able to influence an effect). 
#+end_quote

In pointing to "form" here I take Kant to be construing rational causation as
causation identifiable solely in terms of its character as a kind of universal
necessitation relation, and not in terms of a kind of /temporal/ necessitation
relation. The latter would not be spontaneous, and therefore (given Kant's
identification of spontaneity with the rational) not rational. 

In general Kant thinks of causation in terms of what we would now call "grounding",
so he thinks of it as a kind of asymmetric and irreflexive necessitation relation. He
thinks it takes two basic forms. One is temporal (i.e. first A is posited, and then B
follows necessarily). The other is not (e.g. in a case of pure logical consequence).

#+begin_quote
In reference to “So the conditions of action require appeal to norms that are constitutive of action as such.”

-	I guess part of my concern last week is to somehow address what I feel is a circularity going on in Kant. Somehow, this is also my worry in your statement above. To be free, actions must appeal to norms; but norms (say, moral law), because they are constitutive of actions, is taken as the very condition for freedom. So when S acts according to norms, her acting is governed by that norm – but then we say that that is free.

-	Of course, if this is something that we should take as simply being Kantian, then I do not wish to pursue further. 
#+end_quote

The discussion of "constitutive norms" specifically relates to Korsgaard, and her
reading of Kant (and her ethical/meta-ethical view more generally). Kant does not
think that a free action is one that must be guided by a norm. He thinks that a free
action is one that is the effect of a representation of a rational (causal) law.

But even if we restrict ourselves to Korsgaard, I'm not sure I see the circularity.
Korsgaard conceives of agency as requiring (at least in the most simple case)
consciousness of a some "norm" according to which one acts. So without consciousness
of norms one is not capable of agency. In this sense Korsgaard advocates a kind of
"constitutivism". Constitutivism is usually understood as claiming that the
basic/fundamental norms that apply to X do so in virtue of the nature of X. So in the
case of agency, Constitutivism says that the norms that apply to an agent do so in
virtue of the nature of agency. Hence if one fails to follow the norms one fails, in
that sense, to be an agent. This is not dissimilar from Frankfurt's view that insofar
as one fails to have any second order volitions one fails to have any interest in
what one want, and so fails to be a person, or an agent more broadly.  

#+begin_quote
Now on to the readings for this week. There is much use of the word “incentive” in “Kant’s Religion Within the Boundaries of Mere Reason.” Again, since we are reading Kant, and that he tends to use terms idiosyncratically, I just wanted to ask if there is a special meaning that we need to attach on to it?
#+end_quote

Kant considers an 'incentive' to be a basis of desire. Incentives come in two forms.
An incentive is /either/ a sensory "stimulus" that will cause a desire, or an
intellectual "motive" that will cause a desire.

#+begin_quote
Two questions:
In saying, “an incentive opposed to it must have influence on the power of choice of the human being in question”, does Kant assume that all actions necessarily have incentives incorporated in them?

#+end_quote

That does indeed seem to be Kant's position.

#+begin_quote
Is it possible to imagine, within the Kantian framework, a scenario of freestanding incentive? Let’s say an incentive is acted upon, but is at the same time not incorporated in a maxim, would it, by right of being ipso facto not in the maxim, render the act unfree, or lacking in the capacity for freedom, and ergo immoral? Is it right to say - Where an incentive to act incorporated in a maxim is taken by freewill in doing x is morally good, so an incentive to act not incorporated in a maxim is taken by (free)will in doing x is morally evil?
#+end_quote

Kant's "rigorism" (note the context in which he discusses the Incorporation Thesis in
the /Religion/) consists in thinking that all agents are either "good" or "evil" in the
sense that they either have as their basis for acting some interest in their own
happiness, or they have as their basis for acting their interest in the moral law.
The first involves the "incorporation" of a sensory incentive or "stimulus". The
second involves the incorporation of an intellectual incentive or a "motive". 

**** Janelle
#+begin_quote
How do we understand evil? I am now confused between last week and this week. Does evil track our motives or our actions?
#+end_quote

"Evil" is the action in which we act on the basis of a law of self-love (happiness)
rather than the moral law. Particularly in the /Religion/, Kant seems to deny that free
evil choices (so imputable evil actions) are intelligible. 

#+begin_quote
If it is  impossible for an agent to act in accordance with evil and good maxims at different times, then how do we understand agents that are learning to appreciate the moral law and divorcing themselves from their animal natures.
#+end_quote

The issue of moral "progress" is a tricky one for Kant, all the more so because of
his atemporalist metaphysics. He has to say that what appears as temporal progress is
based on some underlying atemporal set of facts. Of course, we also cannot know what
those facts are (since they are not capable of being experienced). 

#+begin_quote
Is a Frankfurtian account of alien desires that move an agent consistent with how Kant thinks of responsibility? I would say no, but I just wanted to be clear on that.
#+end_quote

Let's see if we agree as to what Frankfurt holds. Frankfurt (or at least on time
slice of him) seems to think that the effective desire that constitutes one's will is
not, merely by virtue of its existing, something for which one is responsible. In
order for one to be responsible one has to have a second-order volition through which
one identifies with the first-order desire. Similar considerations hold on up through
the hierarchy. An 'alien' desire is one with which the agent refuses to identify, or
explicitly sets herself against. Frankfurt's position seems to be that an agent is
not responsible for actions based on effective desires from which one is alienated.

Because Frankfurt's account is non-causal, I don't see how the view is consistent
with what Kant says (assuming, as I do, that Kant's position concerning action is
causal). It also isn't clear whether Kant has a conception of an 'alienated' desire.
He certainly conceives of sensible desire as 'alien' to reason. But this is different
from its being alien to the /person/ whose desire it is. 

**** Eunhong
#+begin_quote
First, I am wondering about the difference between a morally evil action and a morally indifferent action. Secondly, if some of the desires and impulses are not incorporated in maxims, Should all of those desires and impulses be regarded as evil? I think this second question is the following question from the first one. In other words, if some of our maxims has not made it into a universal rule for himself, I am wondering those maxims should always be regarded as evil in Kant’s theory. 
#+end_quote

Kant's position regarding "morally indifferent" actions is that they are the outcome
of natural laws. So the acts of non-rational beings, driven purely by natural laws,
are morally indifferent in this sense. I believe Kant thinks that there are no
morally indifferent acts of rational beings, at least insofar as they are rational,
but rather only acts that are morally permissible and impermissible. So listening to
music in your room is (let's assume) morally permissible, but not morally
indifferent.

Kant thinks that insofar as one acts on a maxim one incorporates an incentive (note:
incentive is distinct from desire; it is the basis or cause of a desire). The
question is the nature of the incentive. If it is a stimulus, or pleasurable
experience that is the basis for a desire, then the maxim is evil. If it is a motive,
or intellectual representation of the moral law, then one's maxim is good. His
"rigorism" denies that there can be an intermediary between these. Moreover, since
Kant also thinks that all of one's maxims are systematically connected in a
hierarchy, one is entirely either good or evil, depending on whether one's 'highest'
maxim is one based on one's own happiness (evil) or on the moral law (good).  

**** Chen
#+begin_quote
But most people in daily life are in the middle. They may do morally good things but also morally bad things. How will Kant evaluate these people? Will Kant say that these people’s good is only contingent? Like, they don’t do morally good things out of the moral law, but out of their own natural propensity and interest? 
#+end_quote

Kant thinks people acting on sensory incentives that they have incorporated into
their maxims are evil. Otherwise they are good. There is no middle ground (see my
response to Eunhong). 

#+begin_quote
Allison explains Kant’s term “apperception” as a “peculiar mode of cognitive self-awareness” (p. 37). Kant states that “the consciousness of myself in this representation ‘I’ is not an intuition, but a merely intellectual representation of the spontaneity of a thinking subject “(p. 37). I will agree if such self-awareness means that when we think or act, we are clearly aware that it is “I” that am thinking or acting, and agree that it is an “inseparable component of the first-order activity itself”. But I do need more explanation about “intellectual” and “intuition” here. 
#+end_quote

"intuition" refers to a sensory experience. Kant thinks that we have intuitions of
objects in space and of our mental states as organized in time. But he thinks we have
some non-sensory awareness of ourselves as well, and in particular of our activity in
performing rational acts (e.g. judging or reasoning). Much of Kant's view here is
obscure. One way I've tried to get at it is through an argument about how we know our
mental acts (or the states and events connected to them) are /ours/.

#+begin_quote
I’m curious about the situation where I am distracted while acting or sleeping, do I lose the cognitive self-awareness then?
#+end_quote

There's an ongoing interpretive debate concerning whether Kant thinks of pure
apperception as always "reflective". If he did then presumable when one is not
reflecting, such as when one is distracted or sleeping (or much of the rest of the
time), then one would fail to have such self-awareness. But it seems plausible to me
that reflection, or the explicit self-awareness characterized in the expression "I
think", is only one way in which such self-awareness is expressed. It can also be
implicit, as when one is focused in thought. In such cases one is not overtly
conscious of one's activity of thinking, yet at every step one know that it is
oneself that is doing the thinking. 
** Week 8
*** Discussion
**** Korsgaard
Korsgaard provides 2 arguments for her compatibilism. Each is based on a slightly
different scenario.

Both arguments are similar in trying to show that the "normative question" must be
raised and answered whether or not determinism is true, and whether or not one /knows/
it to be true. 

We've raised the question of whether it is right to describe what is happening in the
"device" scenario as deliberation, since it is unclear that one is actually the
source of any of the thoughts, or that they are connected to one another by one's
causal activity in the manner seemingly required for deliberation. They all come from
the device. 

The predictor example avoids this problem but it also makes the strong claim that the
"freedom discovered in reflection is not a theoretical property".

1. It seems like the SV people have a way to discuss the broken friendship case, particularly Davidson and how general the view is supposed to be. 
2. How does Velleman’s response do a better job at handling this case? 
#+end_quote

According to the "Standard View" (SV) an agent "participates" in an action just in
case their beliefs and desires interact in a causally non-deviant way to form
intentions to act. This means that all cases in which the agent /fails/ to participate
in the action are going to be cases that either appeal to a mismatch or lack of
desire/belief or appeal to one form or another of causal deviance. Velleman's
friendship example is supposed to be a case where all the conditions for a SV
explanation are satisfied (there is a relevant belief/desire pair, and there are no
causally deviant conditions) but there is nevertheless a lack of participation by the
agent. As Velleman puts it, "I can believe that the decision, though genuinely
motivated by my desires, was thereby induced in me but not formed by me ... Indeed,
viewing the decision as directly motivated by my desires, and my behaviour as
directly governed by the decision, is precisely what leads to the thought that as my
words became more shrill, it was my resentment speaking, not I"

Velleman gives a different account of participation that appeals to a particular kind
of desire---viz. the desire to act for reasons---and assuming he is successful in
arguing that this desire can play proxy for the agent, his view easily accommodates
the idea that one can be alienated from actions that are otherwise a product of one's
beliefs and desire causally interacting in a normal manner.  

**** John
#+begin_quote
why should the agent always act on given motivations? Is it possible to conceive a
scenario in which the agent, in the process of adjudication, abstains or refrains
from acting on motivations? If we can consider refraining from acting on motivations
as a self-determining act, then shall we not consider such action – or, inaction? –
as an exemplification of causal agency?
#+end_quote

It sounds to me like the proposed case of abstaining to act on motivations is either
going to result in an irrational action or no action at all. A similar point would
seem to hold for mental actions such as judgment or belief. 

**** Trevor
#+begin_quote
[In the broken friendship example we] are to think that [Velleman's] beliefs and desires produced an intention that exercised its normal causal powers, “without any contribution from me” (465).

If Velleman is right then Velleman must not be alone. What I mean is that, if a mind contributed to the action, but Velleman didn’t, then it seems like it is someone else’s mind must have caused the action. If some other mind caused the action, then Velleman isn’t alone, but there are two minds occupying his body
#+end_quote

What I think Velleman would say here is that there is a difference between
something's "coming from my mind" and something's "coming from /me/". My mind (or
perhaps "brain" would be better here?) is just a locus for various mental events to
occur, or mental forces to play out. But /me/, or my /self/ is something distinct from
this, such that it makes sense to say that I do not identify with, and thus am
alienated from, at least some of the beliefs, desires, etc. that occur in my mind.
However, that need not entail that there are /two/ selves (or two minds) in one body.

**** Eunhong
#+begin_quote
First, Velleman says the mental events and states are functionally identical to the
agent, but this agent is not the one who can cause agent-causation. Then, what’s the
agent?
#+end_quote

Velleman rejects the idea that agents are substances. He quotes Nagel here:
"Everything I do or that anyone else does is part of a larger course of events that
no one 'does', but that happens, with or without explanation. Everything I do is part
of something I don't do, because I am a part of the world (1986, p. 1 14; cf. Bishop
1989, pp. 39ff.)." Velleman goes on to say that ". Any explanation of human action
will speak in terms of some such occurrences, because occurrences are the basic
elements of explanation in general" (468).

For Velleman the agent is going to be that system of beliefs and desires that mesh
with the overarching desire to act (or believe) according to one's reasons. Here is
Velleman's statement on pp. 479-80:

#+begin_quote
a person's desire to act in accordance with reasons cannot operate in him without its
operations being constitutive of his agency. What it is for this motive to operate is
just this: for potential determinants of behaviour to be critically reviewed, to be
embraced or rejected, and to be consequently reinforced or suppressed. Whatever
intervenes in these ways between motives and behaviour is thereby playing the role of
the agent and consequently is the agent, functionally speaking. Although the agent
must possess an identity apart from the substantive motives competing for influence
over his behaviour, he needn't possess an identity apart from the attitude that
animates the activity of judging such competitions. If there is such an attitude,
then its contribution to the competition's outcome can qualify as his---not because he
identifies with it but rather because it is functionally identical to him. 
#+end_quote

So Velleman continues to avoid any commitment to anything existing above and beyond
the events and states of affairs constituted by there being various beliefs and
desires that occur. He just thinks that one of these desires (the desire to act on
reasons) plays a special role --- it constitutes the agency of the network of beliefs
and desires within which it is enmeshed. Velleman had extensive developed his
conception of agency and the self in other essays. See his /Self to Self/, and /The
Possibility of Practical Reason/.

If causal determinism works, then those events and motives causing Jones to attend Yale will cause him to make the same decision in every possible world. But Franklin claims that the events and motives only provide a probability for Jones to exercise his agent-causal power to make the decision. So is there a possible world in which Jones exercise his agent-causal power to decide not to attend Yale, under the influence of all the same events and motives?
#+end_quote

I think this way of posing the problem conflates logical (possible worlds) with
causal (this world) determinism. But in any case Franklin is thinking that it is
conceptually coherent to think that a set of motives can make it certain (i.e.
probability=1) that Jones decides on Yale, but that it is Jones that decides, and not
that the motives cause a decision that is not itself caused by Jones. 

#+begin_quote
Does it mean that an agent might not have sufficient reasons to do something, but it is the agent’s decision (the exercise of the agent power) that causes something to happen? Thus, the so-called “causes” are merely explanations for decisions to make sense.
#+end_quote

Yes -- and what else are causes but forms of explanation?

#+begin_quote
If the agent is only an intermediary here to transmit the causal power of motives to a certain decision, is there any room for the agent to exercise the agent power? Or, does it mean that the agent power is the power to transmit? It is like, in the constitutional monarchy, the monarch is bound to act on the advice of the government, although the monarch will symbolically endorse the choice of Prime Minister or Prime Minister needs to swear an oath of loyalty to the monarch. 
#+end_quote

I suppose how one answers this depends on how one thinks of an agent-causal power.
Your constitutional monarchy is a good example. If "symbolically endorse" means "has
not causal effect on the outcome/is epiphenomenal" then there is reason to worry that
if Franklin's view of agent-causation has that commitment it is not really causation
at all. But if the Constitutional Monarch has a causal role to play in what becomes
law, by endorsing the prime minister's choice, then even if this endorsement is fully
determined by (e.g.) the parliment, it is still a causally important link, which the
Monarch fulfills. Why then wouldn't the analogue in the agent-causation case be an
instance of agent causation?

#+begin_quote
When an agent exercises the self-determination power to intervene among one’s various and often conflicting motivations and to determine which course of action to pursue (p. 19), is there a reason, an explanation or a motive for the agent to pick up a certain motivation? If he doesn’t, does he randomly choose a motivation and according action to pursue, so the agent’s decision itself is enough for the cause of an event? If he does, could we regard the reason for the agent to choose a motivation as the cause, rather than the agent to be the cause?
#+end_quote

This brings out reasons why libertarianism as an indeterminist view has seemed so
unpalatable to so many. On the one hand it looks like the agent is acting by chance,
and so not really acting rationally/explicably. On the other hand, when the reasons
and decisions are just looked at as events, the agent seems to drop out of the
picture (this is a version of the "disappearing agent objection" to event-causal
libertarian accounts). The proponent of an agent-causation account would have to say
that reason might be causally efficacious in the decision, but it is by way of
causing the agent to decide a particular way, and no simply a cause of the even that
is constituted by that decision.

#+begin_quote
First, I am wondering how Burge and Kant will think of the ontological and metaphysical self
#+end_quote

Burge is rather cagey about this. He does say that "[u]ses of the I concept make
no obvious commitment regarding the metaphysical nature of its referent, other than
that it be an author of thoughts" (385). 

Kant's conception of "authorship" is extremely metaphysically demanding. One is an
author of one's act just in case one bears ultimate causal responsibility for it, and
this is in turn only possible if the act is not itself necessitated by any temporally
prior ground. It seems unlikely to me that Burge would go in for all of this. He does
say that "Deriving metaphysical implications from this commitment [i.e. "I" as
author] would require further argument, which would have to be evaluated on its
merits" (385). My sense is that Burge does want to advocate something stronger than
the kind of reductive theory offered by Frankfurt or Velleman. His Dewey Lectures on
the self indicate that he is not a reductionist, and is somewhat neutral on the issue
of whether dualism is true. See, Burge, Tyler. “Self and Self-Understanding.” /The
Journal of Philosophy/ 108, no. 6/7 (2011): 287–383.

#+begin_quote
Secondly, I am still confused about the difference between having self-knowledge and
having sense-data. (This question might be a similar question that I’ve asked about
Kant’s argument.) Burge says “I have maintained that self-knowledge has a special
epistemic status by virtue of its role in critical reasoning,” and he also argues
that “the nature of critical reasoning requires that some self-knowledge, that which
is essential to rational review, must be epistemically different from observation of
objects.” When we’re saying “having knowledge of an object,” we might think of the
ontological and epistemic status of the object. However, Burge’s self-knowledge
includes or has an epistemic status but different from observation of objects, and
even non-inferential.
#+end_quote

Kant thinks that we have two ways of being aware of ourselves. One is empirical and
derives from ways in which our bodies and minds are affected. The results of such
affection are what Kant distinguishes into feeling, sensation, and intuition. The
other way of being aware of ourselves is non-empirical. This non-empirical awareness
is much harder to characterize. But Kant think it is present in our awareness of our
own mental activity, which I have previously tried to explicate in terms of being
aware that one's mental acts are one's own---i.e. the "mineness" of one's activity.
Kant also thinks that we are aware of ourselves as being the same conscious thinker
across time. Kant does not think this is an empirical inference based on sensory
information we receive about ourselves but rather is presupposed in our being able to
know anything of ourselves or anything else.

Burge similarly advocates a view according to which there are two different ways in
which we can know things about ourselves. The first is broadly empirical or
"observational". One employs such observation to determine, e.g., whether one is
hungry or has a headache. The second is non-empirical (and non-inferential). Burge
thinks that "cogito" like thoughts (e.g. "I am thinking" or "I am thinking that
thereare physical entities") are all ones that one knows that one has without
observation. Such non-observational knowledge is also a condition of what Burge calls
"critical reasoning". He says, "[t]o reason critically in my sense, one must correct,
suspend, change attitudes, conceived as such, on the basis of reasons acknowledged as
such" (386). According to this view, argued for in his paper "Our entitlement to
self-knowledge", the kind of activity in which one changes, adopts, or suspends an
attitude on the basis of reasons requires that one has knowledge of those attitudes
in a manner that cannot (at least in principle) be open to faultless or "brute" error
in the manner that observationally-based knowledge can be. His argument for this is
complex, involving several steps. But he and Boyle share with Kant the view that one
cannot, insofar as one is rational, be radically dissociated in one's reflective
critical activity from one's first-order attitudes that are under critical review or
scrutiny.

For Boyle, it seems that our judging is like a machine which is set in the way we want and we just let the machine operate on its own to provide us the results, our beliefs. If we are indirectly responsible for our believes merely because we have to go through a process to get them, I could also say that we are not directly responsible for our actions because we are only responsible for our intentions and the mechanisms bringing intentions to actions.  
#+end_quote

Boyle wants to reject the position that we related to our beliefs in this sort of
mechanical or "wind-up" manner. I take it that he denies that we are related to our
intentions in this way as well.

#+begin_quote
If Boyle regards beliefs as “continuing endorsement”, he might have to object to the unaware beliefs. Perhaps this is only a minor point, but the question is, does Boyle agree that only the most intense beliefs count as the actuality of agency, or how does he deal with those weaker beliefs?  
#+end_quote

I think Boyle wants to reject accounts like the uneasy flier as accounts as ones
where belief and judgment coincide. Boyle seems to think that the overt judgment that
flying is safe is belied by the behavior, and that the agent doesn't engage in the
activity of "holding" necessary to be credited with a belief that flying is safe.

I think that Boyle does want to accommodate beliefs that aren't the result of
reflection (like perceptual beliefs, or those based on testimony). But he also holds
that in such cases, insofar as the believing is a product of one's agency, it must be
the kind of "holding" that allows for the possibility of reflective scrutiny. 

**** John
#+begin_quote
isn’t holding someone responsible for the control that she has over the policies that she adopts in view of belief formation no less an expression of agency? 
#+end_quote

I don't think anyone (or anyone advocating an agential model, in any case) is
disputing that the adoption of policies for belief formation might be a thing that is
under one's control and thus for which one might be responsible. The question is
whether this is as far as the notion of "doxastic agency" can take us. Both Boyle and
Burge want to advocate a view where the believer/knower is directly responsible for
the relevant doxastic states, without its being the case that this responsibility
takes the form of /willing/ such states into or out of existence (i.e. without adopting
direct doxastic voluntarism). As Boyle puts it "my project here is precisely to lay
the groundwork for a conception of non-voluntaristic doxastic agency, and to argue
that uncritical acceptance of PT is one of the factors that prevents us from seeing
how this might be done" (2011, 17 n. 22).

#+begin_quote
My problem, I guess, is on the explicitness of control in holding that p. I cannot see explicit control in “active affirmative relation to her own present beliefs” (p. 143). Boyle wants persisting assent to p as an expression of control. And he thinks such need not be occurrent, to which I agree. Then again, he could be exposing himself to criticisms from those who claim an asymmetry in explicitness of control between actions and the inexplicitness of control beliefs, to the extent that “engagement with a content” is not as clear as a case of control as, say, hitting a forehand down the line (That said, to say that both extrinsic and intrinsic controls are “rational activities” looks promising. It seems to articulate what a view that I want to adopt in my proposed paper.). 
#+end_quote

I agree that it isn't clear as to the sense in which one has control over beliefs
that one "holds" in the sense Boyle articulates. His aim seems to be denying that
"hitting a forehand down the line" should be our model for controlled activity, since
this privileges a particular kind of causal production---"kinesis"---over the kind of
causal activity he thinks is involved in belief---viz. "energeia". I'm also not sure
that Boyle thinks that rational activity is extrinsically controlled /at all/.

it seems like Burge is saying to understand reasons we must know-why or know-how they have their force or application. Thus, it follows that all that is required for us to know-how or know-why reasons have their force or application, is basically to have a disposition to let them be effective, but does this seem right? 
#+end_quote

I think Burge would agree with your know-how/why gloss (though this is compatible
with his thinking the knowledge is based on entitlement rather than justification)
but would reject the reduction to dispositions in the inference you make. Burge
doesn't seem to think that understand reason and reasons consists in just having some
disposition(s). He says "[u]nderstanding what a reason is, is partly understanding its
motive force, as well as its evaluative norms. To understand reason and reasoning,
this force must be operative in one’s own case; and one must conceptualize its
implementation" (390). Note the use of "partly" here. I take him to be outlining a
necessary but not sufficient condition for such understanding. But it is unclear what
amount to a necessary /and/ sufficient condition here! 

#+begin_quote
Wouldn't instead it be some empirical fact about our minds?
#+end_quote

There are certainly empirical considerations that we have to take into account for
understanding the psychological mechanisms behind reasoning in humans and other
creatures. But I think Burge takes himself to be making an a priori argument
concerning the nature of rational activity ("critical reasoning") as such, and the
conditions for grasping the concepts <reason> and <reasons>.

#+begin_quote
If we are using Anscombe Analogously and why is used in a special way, how does this
hook up with Boyle’s claim about beliefs since one would think we would want (1)-(3).
#+end_quote

I think there is a limit to how far we should take the appeal to Anscombe. One reason
is that Anscombe denies that reasons can be causes. But I don't see that Boyle is
doing this. His main aim seems to be articulating a view of control in belief
formation that respects what he calls in his 2011 paper "Moran's Constraint"

- Moran’s Constraint (MC): :: My reasoning “P, so Q” must normally put me in a
  position to know that I believe that Q because I believe that P.

Boyle takes this to show that in rational beings reflection cannot be in principle alienated
from one's standing beliefs, which means both that reflecting on the question of
whether P has significance for one's believing P, and one's believing P has
significance for one's understanding of why one believes P.  

#+begin_quote
In the case where the why and what question for belief seems inapplicable, how do we
describe the mental state that the agent is in when uttering the expression “I
believe that X.”
#+end_quote

The view that Boyle (and Burge and a variety of other folks) advances denies that we
should construe attitudes that are wholly resistant to evidence, or that occur "in"
us for no reason we can comprehend or endorse as beliefs. They are information states
of some kind, but they are not beliefs. You might look at Helton, Grace. “If You
Can’t Change What You Believe, You Don’t Believe it.” /Noûs/ 54, no. 3 (2020): 501–26
for some related argument.

This is the homepage for *PHIL 971* – Kantian Conceptions of Rational Agency

Kant famously considers moral agency to consist in acting from a grasp of rational
principles as such. But what is a rational principle and what is it to act from such
a principle? In this seminar we'll look at how Kant answers these questions, and
evaluate the theory of rational agency that results. We'll also look at the reception
of Kant's position in contemporary Anglophone philosophy, particularly in the work of
Frankfurt, Korsgaard, Velleman, Reath, and Herman. Some related questions we'll be
trying to find answers to include:

- How does Kant conceive of the connection between rational action and free action? 
- What kind of metaphysical commitments does Kant build into his conception of
  rational action? Do any of these commitments seem plausible today? 
- What is the importance of the capacity for self-consciousness with respect to being rational?

:END:

This week we’ll go over the basic structure and themes of the course and then sketch
Kant’s view of agency. We start with a question: some conditions that an agent may be
in are rationally determinable. Others are not. How should we understand this
difference? More generally, how should we understand the notion of rationality, and
relatedly, of engaging in rational activity? We’ll look at Ram Neta’s setup of this
issue, before turning to Kant’s.

We’ll spend the rest of the meeting looking at some of Kant’s basic metaphysical
commitments regarding agency, specifically his conception of causation and the way in
which he construes an agent as a substance with causal powers to effect change in
itself or other beings.

**** Readings
- Neta, [[/materials/readings/neta-RDCs.pdf][Rationally Determinable Conditions]]
   + We won’t discuss Neta’s positive view in much detail, but the opening pages are
     useful in setting up the issues we’ll be discussing.
- (Optional) Malmgren, [[/materials/readings/malmgren-responsibility.pdf][On Fundamental Responsibility]]
   + Likewise, we won’t look to closely at this point at Malmgren’s positive view,
     but her conception of “fundamental responsibility” is also useful for getting at
     issues central to the course.

      - What’s of interest to us here is Kant’s conception of the connection between
        the Critical philosophy and the capacities of the rational mind.
   + (Optional) CPR: [[/materials/readings/kant-second-analogy.pdf][Second Analogy]]
      - There’s much more here than we can discuss in seminar, but directly relevant

   + McLear, “[[https://www.dropbox.com/s/8d6ar03pwhbstz6/substance.pdf?dl=0][Substance, Capacity, & Act]]”
      - This is my attempt to get clear on the some of the basic elements of Kant’s
        conception of an agent, and of activity. We’ll discuss issues relevant to
        §§1-2 in particular. 
   + (Optional) Watkins, [[/materials/readings/watkins-action.pdf][Kant on Action]]
      - A helpful discussion of how Kant’s conception of action fits in with his
        overall theory of substantial causality.
   + (Optional) Stang, [[/materials/readings/stang-ground.pdf][Guide to Ground in the /Lectures on Metaphysics/]]
      - A helpful discussion of Kant’s conception of “ground” (/Grund/), which is a

This week we’ll start with discussion of Kant’s general commitments concerning substantial

discuss the differences between ‘practical’ and ‘transcendental’ freedom and why the
former might depend on the latter.

      + Note that an “antinomy” here is a conflict of reason with itself. We’ll
        discuss the general issues at stake in the antinomies but the focus will be
        on Kant’s positive conception of “transcendental freedom” in the Third
        Antinomy
   - CPR: [[/materials/readings/kant-canon.pdf][The Canon of Pure Reason]] (excerpt, A800/B828–A804/B832)
      + Here we see Kant discussing “practical freedom”, seemingly in isolation from
        any discussion of freedom in the Antinomies. What is practical freedom and
        what is its relationship to transcendental freedom?
   - CPrR: [[/materials/readings/kant-elucidation.pdf][Critical Elucidation of the Analytic of Pure Practical Reason]] (excerpt, 5:94-102)
      + Here we see a clear argument that freedom of any kind the grounds

Last week we started talking about Kant’s conception of free action. This week we’ll
try and get clearer as to the notion of ‘control’ that lies behind this conception of
free action. In terms of readings from Kant we’ll be focusing on much of the same
material from last week plus a few other things. 

I want to focus our discussion around the following questions:

1. Is Kant’s conception of absolute spontaneity made more intelligible by appeal to
   his view of control? 
2. What is the connection, for Kant, between control and responsibiilty?
3. Does control require choice?
4. If rational acts are all and only those that are under one’s control, and control
   is dependent on choice how does Kant avoid (if he does) an implausibly
   voluntaristic position?

We’ll finish up our discussion of control and time this week. We then move on to look
at how Kant conceives of the freedom of the rational subject (in all its metaphysical
demandingness) includes even the activity of making inferences. We’ll discuss various
issues surrounding Kant’s conception of inference, and why he thinks it is so
metaphysically demanding. I’ve also linked two recent articles. The first, by Ram
Neta, on the “basing relation”, has a variety of points of connection with Kant’s own
view. The second, by Paul Boghossian, is on the “taking condition” more generally as
an account of inference.

*** DONE Week 5 - Reason & Principles
SCHEDULED: <2020-09-15 Tue>
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_HUGO_TAGS: action agency inference laws principles reasoning 
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: week5
:END:

This week we continue our discussion of Kant’s conception of basing and inference. In
particular I want us to try and get clear on the sense in which Kant distinguishes
two different kinds of inferential activity. The first, “immediate” inference, is
carried out by the understanding. The second, “mediate” inference, is carried out by
the faculty of reason (here as a subfaculty, and not a synonym for the intellect as a
whole). What, if anything, is the difference between these two kinds of activity?
Assuming there is something distinctive about the activity of reason as such, what is
it? And can answering this question help us understand another enormously puzzling
claim that Kant makes:

#+begin_quote
Only a rational being has the capacity to act /in accordance with the representation
of laws/, that is, in accordance with principles, or has a /will/. Since reason is
required for the derivation of actions from laws, the will is nothing other than
practical reason. (GII, 4:412)
#+end_quote

So, questions to consider include:

1. What is the difference between mediate and immediate inference?
2. If every faculty has a distinctive kind of activity, what is the distinctive
   activity of (the subfaculty of) reason?
3. What does Kant mean by saying that reason is required for the derivation of action

[[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant/][Immanuel Kant]] (1724--1804) was the most significant German philosopher of the
eighteenth century, and was a key figure in the [[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant/][Enlightenment]]. He wrote most
of his most famous philosophical works relatively late in his professional
life, having only achieved a permanent position as professor in 1770, at the
age of forty-six. From 1781 to 1798 Kant published a series of tremendously
influential philosophical works, including the /Critique of Pure Reason/
(1781/​7), the /Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals/ (1785), the /Metaphysical
Foundations of Natural Science/ (1786), the /Critique of Practical Reason/
(1788), and the /Critique of the Power of Judgment/ (1790).

We'll be primarily focusing on Kant's project in the /Critique of Pure Reason/,
as well as the moral philosophy of the /Groundwork for the Metaphysics of
Morals/ and the /Critique of Practical Reason/. There are certain aspects of
Kant's project in the /Critique of Pure Reason/ that should be very familiar to
those with knowledge of prominent European philosophers of the 17th and 18th
centuries. For example, like Descartes, Locke, and Hume, Kant wishes to
articulate the nature and extent of human knowledge, and to do so in a manner
which proceeds from an analysis of the nature of human cognitive capacities.
Kant believes that human reason requires a ‘critique'---a kind of process of
self-examination or scrutiny---as to whether it is fit to provide us with
knowledge. Kant ultimately argues that human reason is not fit to provide us
with knowledge of a mind-independent reality transcending human experience. In
this sense Kant is deeply sympathetic with ‘empiricist' critiques by Locke,
Berkeley, and Hume of ‘rationalist' philosophers such as Descartes and
Leibniz.

However, Kant also argues that we have much deeper and more extensive
knowledge of the world we experience (or could possibly experience) than his
empiricist predecessors would allow. For example, Kant argues that we have
knowledge of necessary truths concerning aspects of the empirical world (such
as that every event in the empirical world has a cause), as well as truths
which are universal in scope or extent. Thus Kant articulates a view that is
directly opposed to the kinds of skeptical arguments Hume discusses in his
/Treatise/ and first /Enquiry/.

Kant thus thinks that we have knowledge of the necessary and universal laws
governing the empirical world---or more simple, "nature"---while he
nevertheless argues that we are almost wholly ignorant of the fundamental
reality which underlies or grounds the existence of the natural world. In
this way Kant combines various aspects of both the traditional rationalist and
empiricist positions. Like Locke and Hume, Kant thinks we must realize that
the boundaries of human knowledge stop at experience, and thus that we must be
extraordinarily circumspect concerning any claim made about what reality is
like independent of all human experience. But, like Descartes and Leibniz,
Kant thinks that central parts of human knowledge nevertheless exhibit
characteristics of necessity and universality, and that, contrary to Hume's
skeptical arguments, we can have good reason to think that they do.

Kant thus critiques pure reason in order to show its nature and limits, and
thereby curb the pretensions of various metaphysical systems articulated on
the basis of a firm faith that reason alone allows us to scrutinize the very
depths of reality. But Kant also argues that the legitimate domain of reason
is more extensive and more substantive than previous empiricist critiques had
allowed. In this way Kant salvages much of the prevailing Enlightenment
conception of reason as an organ for knowledge of the world.

Below I characterize some of the central aspects of Kant's epistemological
framework and how that framework significantly revolutionized our
understanding of the possible nature and extent of human knowledge.

**** Human Knowledge

***** The A Priori

A variety of philosophers from the Early Modern period (e.g. Descartes,
Leibniz, Hume) argue that there are kinds of knowledge that may be had just by
thinking, and that such forms of knowledge are universal and necessary in
scope. Hume's conception of knowledge made this especially clear. According to
Hume, knowledge of necessary and universal truths must be purely a function of
knowledge of the relations of ideas.

Kant agrees with Hume that a priori knowledge is independent of experience. In
fact, he sees it as definitive of 'pure' a priori knowledge that it be
completely independent of experience in the sense that its content is neither
derived from experience not justified by experience in its application. He
contrasts such knowledge with 'empirical' knowledge or knowledge a posteriori.
A priori knowledge may be more or less 'pure' according to whether or not the
concepts which make it up are themselves a priori knowable. Kant uses the
example 'every alteration has a cause' as an example of /impure/ a priori
knowledge, since the concept <alteration> is empirical.

One important point about Kant's use of 'independent' in describing the a
priori. Kant does not think that a priori knowledge is independent of
experience in the sense that one need not have /any/ experience in order to have
knowledge. On the contrary, Kant thinks that /all/ of our knowledge depends on
our having experience of some kind or another, though he doesn't think this
dependence entails that all our judgments are ultimately /justified/ by
experience. This is why Kant says that

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  But although all our cognition commences with experience, yet it does
  not on that account all arise from experience. (CPR B1)
#+END_QUOTE

There seems to be two reasons for Kant's thinking this. First, we need
experience in order for our cognitive faculties to function and develop.
Second, we may need particular experiences in order to acquire empirical
concepts (e.g. red experiences in order to acquire the concept <red>). This is
what distinguishes pure from impure a priori judgments. Impure a priori
judgments are partially constituted by concepts whose content is in some way
derived from content given by the senses.

If a priori knowledge is, for Kant, knowledge that is (in some sense to
be further specified) /independent/ of experience, that fact is not the
only mark or indicator that some bit of knowledge is a priori. In
addition, Kant argues, any bit of knowledge that is necessary and/or
universal in scope is itself a priori.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Necessity and strict universality are therefore secure indications" of
  an a priori cognition, and also belong together inseparably. But since
  in their use it is sometimes easier to show the empirical limitation
  in judgments than the contingency in them, or is often more plausible
  to show the unrestricted universality that we ascribe to a judgment
  than its necessity, it is advisable to employ separately these two
  criteria, each of which is in itself infallible. (CPR B4)
#+END_QUOTE
  

Kant argues that this conception of a priori knowledge is presupposed in many
empirical judgments as well as in particular sciences. He specifically points
to mathematics ('5+7=12') and to physical judgments ('every alteration has a
cause'). One of Kant's arguments against Humean skepticism is that all of our
empirical knowledge (even that knowledge which we think we have
unproblematically) presupposes a priori knowledge, which itself requires that
there be legitimate use of pure a priori concepts (i.e. concepts which cannot be
derived from any sense impression).

Kant thinks that there are many examples of judgments which we claim to know a
priori, but he is interested primarily in a specific subset of those which
constitute the subject matter of /metaphysics/---viz. judgments concerning God,
the soul (or mind), and immortality. One of Kant's primary aims is to
determine whether metaphysical knowledge is possible, and if it is possible,
what the extent and nature of that knowledge might be. This is what it means
when Kant says that he wishes to set metaphysics "on the secure path of a
science" (e.g. Bxvi). Metaphysical knowledge is problematic, Kant argues,
because unlike other forms of a priori knowledge, such as logic and
mathematics, it is not at all obvious which metaphysical judgments are in fact
correct and thus known, and which are merely thought to be so. This is
exemplified, Kant thinks, by the contentious disputes in which philosophers
have long been involved. Kant provides the following memorable description of
the sad plight of metaphysics. 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In metaphysics we have to retrace our path countless times, because we find
that it does not lead where we want to go, and it is so far from reaching
unanimity in the assertions of its adherents that it is rather a battlefield,
and indeed one that appears to be especially determined for testing one's
powers in mock combat; on this battlefield no combatant has ever gained the
least bit of ground, nor has any been able to base any lasting possession on
his victory. Hence there is no doubt that up to now the procedure of
metaphysics has been a mere groping, and what is the worst, a groping among
mere concepts. (Bxiv-xiv)
#+END_QUOTE 

Kant thus hopes that, by giving a critique of reason, he can demonstrate the
extent to which metaphysics might count as a science. As a secure science it
would rest on a secure set of claims and no longer be a "groping among mere
concepts."

***** The Analytic/Synthetic Distinction

A judgment is known (or knowable) a priori if it is known (or knowable)
independently of experience. Kant thinks that this is not the only dimension
according to which one can analyze a judgment. Kant also argues that all
judgments, in addition to being classifiable as either a priori or a
posteriori (or empirical), may also be classified as being either [[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/analytic-synthetic/][analytic or
synthetic]].

An analytic judgment is one in which the predicate is ‘contained' in the
concept. One way of understanding this notion of ‘containment' is via a claim
about meaning. Accordingly, analytic judgments are those whose truth is known
merely in virtue of knowing the meaning or content of the concepts
constituting the judgment. For example, in the judgment ‘All bachelors are
unmarried' the concept <unmarried> is part of the meaning of <bachelor> and so
the truth of the judgment is grasped just by knowing the relevant meanings or
contents of its component concepts.

Kant also introduces several other markers of analyticity. In total Kant
provides us with four different marks of analyticity. He says that in an
analytic judgment the predicate is

1. ‘contained' within the subject
2. ‘identical' with the subject
3. analytic judgments are ones which are ‘explicative' rather than
   ‘ampliative'
4. analytic judgments are those knowable by means of application of the
   principle of non-contradiction

Which, if any of these markers is best thought of as the main characteristic
of an analytic judgment? This is a disputed issue (cf. @anderson2005;
@proops2005), though certainly, in all cases Kant is thinking of ‘atomic'
judgments of subject-predicate form.

***** The Synthetic A Priori

Kant argues, in ways similar to Locke, Hume, and Leibniz, that analytic
judgments are knowable a priori. Staying with the ‘containment' metaphor,
since the predicate is contained in the subject of an analytic judgment, there
is no need to look beyond the judgment to the world (so to speak) in order to
determine the truth value of the judgment. In this Kant is obviously in
agreement with Locke, Hume, and Leibniz. Kant agrees with his empiricist
predecessors in claiming that all a posteriori judgments are synthetic. Since
the predicate is adding something new to the subject we must look beyond the
judgment to the world---what we can experience---in order that we might
determine the relevant judgments truth or falsity. In non-empirical cases
(like the bachelor example above) the judgment's truth is determined by the
meanings of the concepts constituting it.

Kant's main innovation to the a priori/posteriori and analytic/synthetic
schemas is to note that the analytic a priori and the synthetic a posteriori
do not necessarily exhaust the realm of possible judgments. Here he
essentially can be understood to deny that "Hume's Fork" is an adequate
representation of the structure of human knowledge. According to Kant, there
are also /synthetic a priori/ judgments that are possible. Kant argues that
causal judgments are a clear example.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  it is easy to show that in human cognition there actually are such
  necessary and in the strictest sense universal, thus pure a priori
  judgments. If one wants an example from the sciences, one need only
  look at all the propositions of mathematics; if one would have one
  from the commonest use of the understanding, the proposition that
  every alteration must have a cause will do; indeed in the latter the
  very concept of a cause so obviously contains the concept of a
  necessity of connection with an effect and a strict universality of
  rule that it would be entirely lost if one sought, as Hume did, to
  derive it from a frequent association of that which happens with that
  which precedes and a habit (thus a merely subjective necessity) of
  connecting representations arising from that association (CPR B4-5)
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Take the proposition: "Everything that happens has its cause." In the
  concept of something that happens, I think, to be sure, of an
  existence that was preceded by a time, etc., and from that analytic
  judgments can be drawn. But the concept of a cause lies entirely
  outside that concept, and indicates something different than the
  concept of what happens in general, and is therefore not contained in
  the latter representation at all. How then do I come to say something
  quite different about that which happens in general, and to cognize
  the concept of cause as belonging to it, indeed necessarily, even
  though not contained in it? What is the unknown=X here on which the
  understanding depends when it believes itself to discover beyond the
  concept of A a predicate that is foreign to it yet which it
  nevertheless believes to be connected with it? (CPR B13-14)
#+END_QUOTE

Kant argues here that our judgments concerning events presuppose that they do
not just /occur/ but are /caused to occur/, that we know this to be true
necessarily and universally, and that we have no explanation of this fact
unless the judgments we make in such cases are synthetic a priori judgments.
The question remains, however, just how such synthetic a priori judgments
could be possibly true, much less known to be so. What is it that could link
the concepts in a subject-predicate judgment such that the truth of the
judgment holds necessarily and universally, while its nevertheless being true
that the predicate is not contained in the subject of the judgment, and thus
that the judgment is not analytic?

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Now the entire final aim of our speculative a priori cognition rests
  on such synthetic, i.e., ampliative principles; for the analytic ones
  are, to be sure, most important and necessary, but only for
  attaining that distinctness of concepts which is requisite for a
  secure and extended synthesis as a really new acquisition (CPR B13-14)
#+END_QUOTE

Kant argues that we need to explain how synthetic a priori judgments are
possible, and that the explanation of the possibility of significant portions
of our knowledge rests on this, including mathematics and natural science, as
well as the very possibility of metaphysics.

***** Mathematics and the Synthetic A Priori

Recall that for Hume, mathematical knowledge was a function merely of
knowledge of relations of ideas, in other words, that math is analytic
and a priori. Kant disputes this. Our mathematical knowledge is
certainly a priori, he thinks, but it is not explained in terms of
relations of ideas or concepts (i.e. in terms of containment or any of
the other marks of analyticity). Instead, Kant argues that mathematical
knowledge must be /synthetic/, but since it is necessary and universal,
also /a priori/. Here's how Kant puts the point in his /Prolegomena/:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  The essential feature of pure mathematical cognition, differentiating
  it from all other a priori cognition, is that it must throughout
  proceed not from concepts, but always and only through the
  construction of concepts (Critique, p. 713). Because pure mathematical
  cognition, in its propositions, must therefore go beyond the concept
  to that which is contained in the intuition corresponding to it, its
  propositions can and must never arise through the analysis of
  concepts, i.e., analytically, and so are one and all synthetic.
  (/Prolegomena/ 4:272, p. 20)
#+END_QUOTE

Kant uses two examples in his argument concerning mathematics. The first
is the judgment '7+5=12' and the second is the geometric judgment that
'the shortest distance between two points is a straight line'. Though
both judgments are knowable a priori, Kant thinks that in neither of
these two cases can we explain the truth of the judgments analytically.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  One might well at first think: that the proposition 7 + 5 = 12 is a
  purely analytic proposition that follows from the concept of a sum of
  seven and five according to the principle of contradiction. However,
  upon closer inspection, one finds that the concept of the sum of 7 and
  5 contains nothing further than the unification of the two numbers
  into one, through which by no means is thought what this single number
  may be that combines the two. The concept of twelve is in no way
  already thought because I merely think to myself this unification of
  seven and five, and I may analyze my concept of such a possible sum
  for as long as may be, still I will not meet with twelve therein.
  (/Prolegomena/ 4:268-9, p. 18)
#+END_QUOTE

Kant's argument here is that while it might be analytically true that
the sum of 7 and 5 is /a number/ (and also that it must be a /natural
number/), it is not clear from analysis alone that the sum is equal to
12, or any other pair of natural numbers which might sum to 12.

Kant seems to think that to the extent one finds the answer twelve
/obvious/ one is adverting, either explicitly or implicitly, to some
particular experience of adding units, such as counting on one's
fingers, or adding up objects (e.g. apples, chairs, blocks, etc.).

Also, if '7+5=12' is known analytically, then in thinking it one is
equivalently thinking of any or all the numbers which are equal to 12,
including /very large/ numbers (e.g. any numbers /m/ and /n/ which might yield 12).
This certainly doesn't reflect our experience when calculating such sums,
which may yield further evidence that the judgment isn't analytically true.

**** The Copernican Turn

In a famous passage in the second edition of the /Critique of Pure Reason/ Kant
makes an analogy between the strategy pursued by his critical philosophy and
the central contribution of Nicolas Copernicus.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Up to now it has been assumed that all our cognition must conform to
  the objects; but all attempts to find out something about them a
  priori through concepts that would extend our cognition have, on this
  presupposition, come to nothing. Hence let us once try whether we do
  not get farther with the problems of metaphysics by assuming that the
  objects must conform to our cognition, which would agree better with
  the requested possibility of an a priori cognition of them, which is
  to establish something about objects before they are given to us. This
  would be just like the first thoughts of Copernicus, who, when he did
  not make good progress in the explanation of the celestial motions if
  he assumed that the entire celestial host revolves around the
  observer, tried to see if he might not have greater success if he made
  the observer revolve and left the stars at rest. Now in metaphysics we
  can try in a similar way regarding the intuition of objects. (CPR
  Preface, Bxvi-xvii)
#+END_QUOTE

So just as Copernicus sought to explain the apparent motions of objects
in the heavens in terms of the movement of the earthbound observer, so
too Kant attempts to account for the apparent characteristics of objects
in terms of our cognitive faculties and the cognitive conditions under
which we know the objective world. In Kantian phrase, instead of
assuming that our knowledge of the object must conform to /it/, we
assume that it conforms to /our knowledge/.

**** Transcendental Idealism

Kant's name for the position he articulates according to which objects
must conform to our way of knowing them is ‘Transcendental Idealism.'
Though the exact meaning of Transcendental Idealism is much disputed by
Kant's interpreters, it is clear that he intends at least two things by
it.

First, according to Transcendental Idealism, space and time are neither
independent subsisting entities (as was suggested by Newton), nor
object-dependent orders of relations between entities (as was argued by
Leibniz). Instead, they are mind-dependent 'forms of intuition.' They are thus
understood in terms of the characteristic ways in which we experience things
rather than either being mind-independent things that we experience, or
relations between mind-independent things that we experience. Kant argues that
space and time are nevertheless 'empirically real' --- they are fundamental
features of the empirical world that we experience. But they are not real ‘in
themselves.' They have no ultimate reality apart from our capacity for
experience.

Second, in addition to the transcendental ideality of space and time, to
which all experienced objects must conform, Kant argues that empirical
reality is itself further structured by a privileged set of a priori concepts.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  experience itself is a kind of cognition requiring the understanding,
  whose rule I have to presuppose in myself before any object is given
  to me, hence a priori, which rule is expressed in concepts a priori,
  to which all objects of experience must therefore necessarily conform,
  and with which they must agree. As for objects insofar as they are
  thought merely through reason, and necessarily at that, but that (at
  least as reason thinks them) cannot be given in experience at all -
  the attempt to think them (for they must be capable of being thought)
  will provide a splendid touchstone of what we assume as the altered
  method of our way of thinking, namely that we can cognize of things a
  priori only what we ourselves have put into them (CPR Preface,
  Bxvii-xviii)
#+END_QUOTE

Kant here argues that the object which appear to one in perceptual
experience, or ‘intuition' as he calls it, also must conform to our
basic conceptual scheme. He explains what he means here in the last
sentence: objects must conform to our conceptual scheme because that
scheme makes possible the experience of such objects.

Though elements of Kant's ‘Copernican' strategy remain unclear,
the basic idea is that Kant argues that what makes synthetic a priori
knowledge possible is the structure of our cognitive faculties,
including the pure forms of intuition and a privileged set of a priori
concepts. These forms and concepts jointly make experience possible and
allow us to draw inferences that hold with necessity and universality
concerning objects encountered in experience. What's more, Kant argues
that because a priori concepts are necessary for experience in general,
we can know that those concepts are applied legitimately, since he is
taking it as obvious that we have experience.

**** The Analogies   
Kant entitles the section of the System of All Principles discussing the relational categories the "Analogies of Experience." Kant discusses the category of /cause/ in the second of his three ‘Analogies'. The Analogies are part of the ‘Analytic of Principles' in which Kant discusses each of the twelve categories and their relation to the objects of experience at much greater length than he does in the argument of the Transcendental Deduction, where he is concerned with the categories' general relation to objects of experience. Before we go on to discuss Kant's view of causality in detail let's start with a few background issues. First, what does Kant mean here by an "analogy"?

Kant distinguishes between analogy in mathematics and analogy in philosophy (B221) and defines analogy in philosophy as

#+begin_quote
not the identity of two *quantitative* [relations, as in mathematical analogy] but [the identity] of two *qualitative* relations, where from three given members I can cognize and give /a priori/ only the *relation* to a fourth member but not *this* fourth *member* itself, although I have a rule for seeking it in experience and a mark for discovering it there (B222)
#+end_quote

It is not clear from this remark what the fundamental difference is between
mathematical and philosophical analogy.[fn:2] He goes on to say that

#+begin_quote
An analogy of experience will therefore be only a rule in accordance with which unity of experience is to arise from perceptions (not as a perception itself, as empirical intuition in general), and as a principle it will not be valid of the objects (of the appearances) *constitutively* but merely *regulatively*. (B222)
#+end_quote

Though Kant's position here is complicated, and interpretations contested, at least this much is clear. First, the paragraph immediately above points out that the relational categories are not constitutive of appearances, intuition, or the perception thereof. That is, they are not the conditions of the possibility of such representations. Instead they are constitutive only of experience, insofar as it can be constructed from the connected series of intuitions in a perception. Second, that there is supposed to be a general structure to the analogies such that a is to b as c is to /x/, where /x/ is that which is to be sought in an experience.

Fortunately, for our purposes, we need not have an exact conception of what an analogy is to appreciate the basic points of his argument in the Second Analogy. But we do need to understand the exact relation between the category <cause-effect> and the representation of time.

Kant distinguishes three different kinds of temporality (B219): persistence, succession, and simultaneity. He then claims that each kind of temporality is connected with each of the relational categories (i.e. persistence with <substance-inherence>, succession with <cause-effect>, and simultaneity with <community>).  

Kant therefore prefaces his discussion of the three Analogies of Experience with a single principle, which, in the first edition, reads: “As regards their existence, all appearances stand a priori under rules of the determination of their relation to each other in one time” (A176) and in the second, reads: “Experience is possible only through the representation of a necessary connection of perceptions” (B218). The basic idea here is that each of the three relational categories represents a necessary connection that is required for the possibility of /experience/ (not intuition or perception!) of (i) a single time and (ii) of objects existing and being temporally related to each other within a single time.

Two further points of background are worth discussing before proceeding to the Second Analogy itself. First, Kant denies that we can perceive time itself (B219), which is to say that Kant denies that we have conscious awareness of /time/, as opposed to the persistence, succession, or simultaneity of representations that occur /in/ time.

Second, Kant assumes a distinction between an objective temporal order between states of objects (and between objects) and the subjective temporal appearance of such order, construed merely as the subjective succession of representations in a particular empirical mind. Much of Kant's discussion is then aimed at answering the question "how do I manage to cognize and know anything about an objective temporal order if all I have access to is the subjective temporal succession of my own representations?"

[fn:2] See [@callanan2008] for extensive discussion and citations. 


**** The Second Analogy

The Second Analogy concerns the /cause-effect/ relation. The "unschematized" (i.e. the "pure" and non-temporal) version of the category says that given the existence of some ground, its consequence necessarily exists. But this says nothing further about the relata, the relation between ground and consequence, or the nature of the relation of necessity that holds between them. In the Second Analogy we see the schematized version of the category, and thus the elaboration of the necessary relation as a /temporal/ one. He states this as follows:

#+begin_quote
  All alterations occur in accordance with the law of the connection of cause
  and effect (B232)
#+end_quote

In other words, all alterations occur lawfully, such that all alterations occur due to causes from which they necessarily follow. 

What is an "alteration"? Kant says that "the concept of alteration presupposes one and the same subject as existing with two opposed determinations, and thus as persisting" (B233). This indicates that Kant is primarily concerned with a change of state in a substance. An alteration is the change of a substance from one state (or the possession of a property) to another, e.g. from hot to cold, thin to fat, black to white, etc. Kant thus seeks to validate the principle that there can be no alteration in a substance that is not due to some cause.   

Kant conceives of all change in terms of alteration. So the Second Analogy ends up being an argument concerned with our ability to cognize change with respect to the objects of experience. Kant's view is that all change with respect to such objects must be understood temporally, and as requiring that the change be the effect of some cause. 

One issue related to this way of setting up the problem of causation is that it is unclear whether the success of the Second Analogy is supposed to show that no alteration takes place except as the result of /some/ cause, or that no alteration takes place except as the result of the /same type/ of cause. The phrasing of the principle supports only the first, weaker reading, but lawful causation is often taken to require that the same type of cause always yields the same type of effect (e.g. fire causes heat). 

A further issue is whether the argument Kant presents for the causal principle ends up being one that engages in any way with Hume's skeptical position concerning causation. Recall that according to Hume we have no impression of necessary connection, and so there cannot be any legitimacy to the use of the concept of necessary connection in our experience of objects. For Hume, casual judgments are the result of being habituated to expect the occurrence of one event given the occurrence of another (e.g. to expect that heat will accompany fire). 

***** The Argument

Much of Kant's argument in the Second Analogy proceeds by way of the following starting point or assumption: We are able to represent (and ultimately come to know) the difference between the subjective succession or simultaneity of our own states, and the objective succession or simultaneity of states in an object. How is this so much as possible?

Understanding Kant's argument in this way suggests that he is engaged in a manner of argumentation that we've termed a "transcendental" argument. That is, an argument that starts from an assumption concerning some actual phenomenon and regresses to the conditions of that actual phenomenon's possibility. Kant provides two examples to motivate this assumption, that of the visual experience of (the parts of) a house, and the experience of a ship moving downriver. We distinguish the representation of a persisting object, such as a house, from a series of events, such as a ship moving downriver. But in both cases there is no difference subjectively in what occurs (at least at a certain level of abstraction), namely a succession of subjective perceptions. As Kant says,

#+begin_quote
The apprehension of the manifold of appearance is always successive. The representations of the parts succeed one another. Whether they also succeed in the object is a second point for reflection, which is not contained in the first (B234)
#+end_quote

So how is it that we can distinguish in the ship case that we have an objective /succession/ of events, while in the house case we have objective /simultaneity/---one persisting object, whose parts (e.g. roof, walls, windows, etc.) we perceive successively but are in fact simultaneous?

Kant rules out several possibilities. We can't distinguish objective succession from objective simultaneity by the intuition or perception of any necessary connection because (and here Kant agrees with Hume) experience “to be sure tells us what is, but not that it must necessarily be so and not otherwise” (B3). Second, the supposed irreversibility of our perception of successive events (such as with the riverboat case) cannot tell us anything because one can only be aware of the relevant contrast between 'reversible' and 'irreversible' perceptions if one is /already/ aware that there is an irreversible order (e.g. that B's following A and not vice versa) to what one is perceiving, such that one's perceptions must be in accord with it. Third, one cannot appeal to some independently perceivable temporal succession (‘absolute' time), because Kant has already ruled out the possibility of perceiving time itself (B 245). Fourth, one cannot appeal to the perception of any mind-independent object (a ‘thing in itself'), since these too have been ruled out as wholly inaccessible to our conscious awareness.

So Kant has issued a challenge: granted that a subject of experience has a grasp of the distinction between objective succession of alterations in an object (e.g. in the motion of a ship downstream) and the objective simultaneity of the features of an object (e.g. the various features of a house), what account for such awareness? This is a problem for the Humean as well, since that view presupposes that we at least sometimes make causal judgments based on a grasp of a determinate temporal sequence (i.e. of some event B following event A).[fn:57] Hence the Humean account of habituation and causal judgment presupposes that we can distinguish the objective sequence of events from our subjective train of sense experiences.

Kant's claim then, is that it is only if there is a rule ordering our representations, such that what makes it possible for us to grasp two events as related by objective temporal succession is that one event /caused/ the other. Here is a reconstruction of the whole argument, as articulated by Georges Dicker (@dicker2004, 173).

1. We cannot know by observation that an event---that is, a transition from a state A to a state B---is occurring by knowing that the perceptions of A and B occur in the order A, B; by knowing that the perceptions of A and B are irreversible; by knowing that A precedes B by reference to absolute time; or by knowing that these perceptions are of successive states of things-in-themselves.
2. If (1), then the only way we can know by perception that an event---that
   is, a transition from a state A to a state B---is occurring is by knowing
   that B follows A according to a rule, that is, that the event has a cause.
3. If the only way we can know by perception that an event---that is, a
   transition from a state A to a state B---is occurring is by knowing that B
   follows A according to a rule, that is, that the event has a cause, then
   any event such that we can know of its occurrence by perception must have a
   cause.
4. \therefore Any event such that we can know of its occurrence by perception must
   have a cause.

Kant's conclusion here is limited in several ways. First, it concerns only knowledge that empirical events have causes. It does not say, e.g., that similar events always have similar causes. Second, it presupposes that we have knowledge of the objective succession of events. Third, it presupposes that we correctly grasp the distinction between objective succession and objective simultaneity. But, despite these presuppositions, the argument seems an effective answer to the Humean, for the Humean analysis of causation requires that we have a grasp of objective succession (as well as the distinction between objective simultaneity and succession), for this is used by the Humean to explain how our associative powers get their grip on causal judgment. Hence, while Kant's argument concerning causation may not be effective against all comers, particularly against the skeptic who might deny that we have any cognitive grasp of objective succession, it nevertheless seems effective against Hume's argument.

[fn:57] Note that Kant's argument doesn't obviously affect a version of the Humean view that regards causal judgment as based on habituation due to there /being/ a temporal order amongst our representations. Kant's argument only affects the more robust view that we must /represent/ the temporal order amongst our representations for causal judgment to occur.
