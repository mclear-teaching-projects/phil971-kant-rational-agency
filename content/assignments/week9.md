This week we will finish up our discussion of agent-causation from last week,
focusing on Velleman's functional and reductive account of agent-causation and
Franklin's "It Ain't Me" argument. We'll then turn to two recent arguments on the
relation between rationality and various forms of self-consciousness or
self-knowledge.
